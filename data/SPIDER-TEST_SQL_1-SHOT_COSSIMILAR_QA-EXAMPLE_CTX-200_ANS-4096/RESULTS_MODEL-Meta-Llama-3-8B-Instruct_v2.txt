SELECT Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, the answer to the second question is: SELECT SUM(cost) as total_cost FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'declaration' GROUP BY idcase This SQL query will sum up the cost of each declaration and group the results by idcase.
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) as num_events FROM event_log GROUP BY resource HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100 ORDER BY num_events DESC;
SELECT Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS num_events FROM event_log GROUP BY resource HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100 ORDER BY num_events DESC; This query: 1. Selects the resource column and counts the number of events each resource is involved in using the COUNT(*) function. 2. Groups the results by the resource column using the GROUP BY clause. 3. Filters the results to only include resources that acted in at least 100 events using the HAVING clause. 4. Sorts the results in descending order of the number of events per resource using the ORDER BY clause.

SELECT It seems like you're trying to solve a SQL query problem. Based on the provided database schema and the problem statement, here's the answer: /* Retrieve all cases and their events, ordering them by case number and start date of their performance */ SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp FROM event_log ORDER BY idcase, MIN(timestamp) This query will return all the events from the event_log table, ordered by the case number (idcase) and then by the start date of each case (MIN(timestamp)).
SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp FROM event_log ORDER BY idcase, MIN(timestamp)
SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_date, activity FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity ORDER BY idcase, start_date;

SELECT resource, COUNT(*) as total_count FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration approved by administration' GROUP BY resource
SELECT Based on the provided SQL examples and database schema, the correct answer is: SELECT COUNT(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration approved by administration' GROUP BY resource This SQL query counts the number of occurrences in which the 'declaration approved by administration' activity was performed, considering each of the resources available in the business process. The result is grouped by the resource, providing the quantity of occurrences for each resource.
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS num_approvals FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration approved by administration' GROUP BY resource

The query filters the event log to only include records where the timestamp is within the year 2017, and the resource field contains the name "Thomas". The results are then grouped by activity and ordered by frequency in descending order.

This will give the total number of declaration requests made by the employee Thomas.

SELECT Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, the answer to the second question is: SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by pre-approver'; This SQL query will return a list of unique resources associated with instances of the 'declaration rejected by pre-approver' activity. The DISTINCT keyword is used to ensure that only unique resources are returned, and the WHERE clause filters the results to only include rows where the activity is 'Declaration rejected by pre-approver'.

The DISTINCT keyword is used to ensure that each resource is only listed once, even if they have rejected multiple declarations.

SELECT Based on the provided SQL example, the correct answer would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-01' AND '2017-06-01' GROUP BY resource This SQL query will count the number of distinct cases (idcase) for each resource, considering only the events that occurred between 1/5/2017 and 1/6/2017. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by the resource column, and the COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) function counts the number of unique idcase values for each group.

SELECT Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING strftime('%Y-%m', MIN(timestamp)) < '2017-03' This query groups the event log by case ID and then filters the results to only include cases where the minimum timestamp (i.e., the first log record) is before March 2017.

SELECT It seems like you're asking me to answer two SQL questions. **Question 1: In which cases was the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity performed? Provide the answer in ascending temporal order.** The SQL query provided is correct. It finds the cases where the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity was performed, and returns the results in ascending temporal order. Here's a breakdown of the query: 1. The subquery selects the minimum timestamp for each case (idcase) and groups the results by case. 2. The main query joins the event_log table with the subquery result, matching on the idcase column. 3. It filters the results to only include rows where the activity is 'Declaration rejected by supervisor'. 4. The results are ordered by the timestamp in ascending order. **Question 2: What is the performance of actions that are associated with the declaration being approved by the supervisor?** Unfortunately, the SQL query provided is incomplete. To answer this question, we would need to know what specific metrics or performance indicators are being asked for (e.g., total cost, number of actions, etc.). If you could provide more context or clarify what you're looking for, I'd be happy to help you craft a SQL query to answer this question!

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases, activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY num_cases DESC;
SELECT Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, the correct answer is: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases, activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity This SQL query will count the number of distinct cases (idcase) for each activity and return the result as a table with two columns: num_cases and activity. The num_cases column will contain the count of cases for each activity, and the activity column will contain the unique activities.
SELECT activity, count(*) FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, the answer to the second question would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity; This SQL query counts the number of unique declarations (idcase) for each possible action (activity) in travel declaration processing. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by the activity, and the COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) function counts the number of unique idcase values for each activity.

SELECT Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS count FROM event_log WHERE timestamp = '2018-03-02' AND idcase IS NOT NULL GROUP BY activity ORDER BY count DESC; This query: 1. Filters the event log to only include rows where the timestamp is March 2, 2018. 2. Filters the event log to only include rows where the idcase is not null (i.e., it's a completed case). 3. Groups the remaining rows by the activity. 4. Counts the number of times each activity appears in the group. 5. Orders the results by the count in descending order (so the most frequent activities appear first). The result will be a list of activities and the number of times they appear in the subset of cases completed on March 2, 2018.
