Here's a breakdown of the query: - `idcase`: The unique identifier for each case. - `strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp))`: Converts the maximum timestamp of each case to Unix time (seconds since 1970-01-01). - `strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp))`: Converts the minimum timestamp of each case to Unix time. - `MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)`: Calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps, giving the duration in seconds.
SELECT To approximate the total time for each case, you can calculate the difference between the first and last timestamps for each `idcase`. Here's how you can do it: ```sql SELECT idcase, (strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp))) AS total_duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` Explanation: 1. `strftime('%s', timestamp)` converts the timestamp to Unix time (seconds since 1970-01-01). 2. `MAX(timestamp)` gets the latest timestamp for each `idcase`. 3. `MIN(timestamp)` gets the earliest timestamp for each `idcase`. 4. The difference between `MAX(timestamp)` and `MIN(timestamp)` gives the total duration in seconds for each `idcase`. 5. The query groups the results by `idcase` to calculate the total duration for each case individually.
SELECT To calculate the approximate duration of each case, you need to determine the time difference between the first and last event for each case. Here's the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT idcase, strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp)) AS duration_seconds FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` This query does the following: 1. Groups the events by `idcase`. 2. For each group (case), it calculates the minimum and maximum timestamps. 3. Computes the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps to get the duration in seconds. 4. Returns the `idcase` and the calculated duration in seconds. If you want the duration in a more human-readable format (e.g., hours, minutes, and seconds), you can further process the result in your application or use additional SQL functions to format the output.
SELECT To determine how long each case lasts, you need to calculate the difference between the earliest and latest timestamps for each case. Here's the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT idcase, (strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp))) AS case_duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` This query works as follows: 1. `strftime('%s', timestamp)` converts the timestamp to Unix time (the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). 2. `MIN(timestamp)` and `MAX(timestamp)` find the earliest and latest timestamps for each case (`idcase`). 3. The difference between `MAX(timestamp)` and `MIN(timestamp)` gives the duration of each case in seconds. 4. The results are grouped by `idcase` to ensure each case's duration is calculated separately.
SELECT To report the duration of each case, you need to calculate the difference between the earliest and latest timestamps for each `idcase`. Here's how you can do it: ```sql SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` This query groups the events by `idcase` and calculates the duration by subtracting the minimum timestamp from the maximum timestamp for each case. The result will give you the duration of each case.

Here's how you can do it: 1. Identify the start time of each case. 2. Identify the end time of each case. 3. Calculate the difference between the end time and the start time for each case. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql WITH CaseStartEnd AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) SELECT idcase, (strftime('%s', end_time) - strftime('%s', start_time)) AS duration FROM CaseStartEnd; ``` Explanation: - The `CaseStartEnd` common table expression (CTE) calculates the minimum (`MIN`) and maximum (`
SELECT To answer the question "Which cases had the same resource allocated for all performances of their activities and what was the resource?", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` Explanation: - `GROUP BY idcase, resource`: This groups the records by both `idcase` and `resource`. - `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1`: This ensures that each `idcase` has only one distinct `resource` associated with it, meaning all activities within that case were handled by the same resource. This query will return the `idcase` and the `resource` for cases where all activities were handled by the same resource.
SELECT To answer the question "Which cases had the same resource allocated to all their activities? Who was the resource?", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` Explanation: - `GROUP BY idcase, resource`: This groups the records by both `idcase` and `resource`. - `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1`: This ensures that only cases where all activities were handled by the same resource are selected. Since we are grouping by both `idcase` and `resource`, the `COUNT(DISTINCT resource)` will always be 1 for each group, effectively filtering out cases where multiple resources were involved. This query will return the `idcase` and the `resource` for cases where all activities were handled by the same resource.
SELECT To answer the question "Which cases had the same resource allocated for all performances of their activities, and who was the resource?", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` Explanation: 1. **GROUP BY idcase, resource**: This groups the records by both `idcase` and `resource`. 2. **HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1**: This ensures that only those groups where the count of distinct resources is 1 are selected, meaning the same resource handled all activities for that case. This query will return the `idcase` and the `resource` for cases where the same resource was allocated for all performances of their activities.
SELECT To list the cases and the resource in which all activities are handled by the same resource, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` This query groups the records by `idcase` and `resource`, and then filters the groups to include only those where the count of distinct resources is 1.

The outer query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `cost` is equal to the maximum cost found by the subquery. This will return all events that have the highest cost.
SELECT To find the events that have the maximum cost amount, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log); ``` This query first determines the maximum cost from the `event_log` table using a subquery and then selects all events that have this maximum cost.
SELECT To present the events whose costs are equal to the highest cost, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The subquery `(SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)` finds the highest cost in the `event_log` table. 2. The outer query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `cost` is equal to the highest cost found by the subquery.
SELECT To present the events whose costs are maximum, you need to find the maximum cost and then select the events that have this maximum cost.

SELECT To present the highest-cost events based on the given database schema, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5; ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table, orders the results by the `cost` column in descending order, and limits the output to the top 5 rows, which represent the highest-cost events.
SELECT To present the events whose cost amounts are the highest, you can use a query similar to the previous examples. Here is the complete SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost IN ( SELECT DISTINCT cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5 ) ORDER BY cost DESC; ``` This query will select all columns from the `event_log` table for the events that have the highest costs. The subquery selects the distinct costs from the `event_log` table, orders them in descending order, and limits the results to the top 5 highest costs. The outer query then retrieves the events that have these top 5 costs. The final `ORDER BY cost DESC` ensures that the results are ordered by cost in descending order.

This includes information such as the event ID, activity name, timestamp, resource, cost, and case ID. Here is the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'; ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` column starts with 'Permit'. This will give you a detailed view of each event where a 'permit' activity was performed, allowing you to characterize these events based on their attributes.
SELECT To answer the question "What characterizes the events associated with the performance of the 'permit' activity?", you would typically want to look at various attributes of the events where the activity is related to 'permit'. This could include the timestamp, resource, cost, and idcase. Here's an example SQL query that retrieves these details: ```sql SELECT id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'; ``` This query will return all the events where the activity starts with 'Permit', along with their associated details such as the timestamp, resource, cost, and idcase. This information can help you characterize the events associated with the performance of the 'permit' activity.
SELECT To show the attribute costs of the events associated with the 'permit' activity, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT cost FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'permit'; ``` This query selects the `cost` attribute from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'permit'.
SELECT To answer the question "The 'permit' activity is associated with which events? List the attribute values of these events," you need to select all the columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` column contains the word 'permit'. Here is the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%permit%'; ``` This query will return all the rows from the `event_log` table where the `activity` column contains the word 'permit', and it will list all the attribute values of these events.
SELECT To answer the question "What characterizes the interventions that generate a permit during the processing of a declaration?", we need to identify the specific attributes or characteristics of the events that involve permits within the context of declaration processing. This could include details such as the activities, timestamps, resources involved, and costs associated with these interventions. Given the provided database schema and the context, we can construct a query to extract relevant information. Here's a possible SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%permit%' AND idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%declaration%' ); ``` Explanation: 1. **SELECT id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase**: We select all relevant columns to get a comprehensive view of each event. 2.
SELECT To answer the question "What information is associated with permit interventions, within the processing of a declaration?" based on the given database schema, you would need to retrieve all relevant details from the `event_log` table where the activities involve both 'permit' and 'declaration'. Here is a SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%declaration%' ) AND activity LIKE '%permit%'; ``` This query works as follows: 1. The subquery `SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%declaration%'` retrieves all `idcase` values where the activity involves a declaration. 2. The outer query then selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `idcase` is in the list of `idcase` values from the subquery and the activity involves a permit. This ensures that you get all the

SELECT To answer the question about the performance of actions associated with the declaration being approved by the supervisor, we need to identify the relevant activities and then analyze their performance metrics. Assuming "performance" refers to metrics such as the number of occurrences, average time taken, and possibly the cost associated with these actions, we can write a query to extract this information. Here's a query that provides a summary of the performance metrics for actions associated with the declaration being approved by the supervisor: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count, AVG(julianday(next_event.timestamp) - julianday(event_log.timestamp)) * 24 * 60 AS avg_duration_minutes, AVG(cost) AS avg_cost FROM event_log LEFT JOIN event_log AS next_event ON event_log.idcase = next_event.idcase AND event_log.timestamp < next_event.timestamp WHERE event_log.activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY activity

SELECT To answer the question "Which activities were performed more than three times?" based on the provided database schema, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` This query groups the records by the `activity` column and counts the number of occurrences of each activity. The `HAVING` clause filters the results to include only those activities that were performed more than three times.
SELECT To list activities that were performed more than three times in the entire event log, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(activity) > 3; ``` This query groups the records by the `activity` column and then filters those groups to include only those where the count of occurrences is greater than three.
SELECT To list the activities that were performed more than three times, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` This query groups the records by the `activity` column and counts the number of occurrences of each activity. The `HAVING` clause filters the results to include only those activities that were performed more than three times.
SELECT To recover activities that have been performed more than three times across all cases, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(activity) > 3; ``` This query groups the records by the `activity` column and then filters out the groups where the count of activities is greater than three. This will give you a list of activities that have been performed more than three times in total, regardless of the case.
SELECT To answer the question "What activities were performed more than three times?" based on the provided database schema, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` This query groups the records by the `activity` column and counts the number of occurrences of each activity. The `HAVING` clause filters the results to include only those activities that were performed more than three times. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of occurrences of each activity.
SELECT To answer the question "What are the activities for which there are more than three records of their performance?" based on the provided database schema, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` This query groups the records by the `activity` column and counts the number of records for each activity.

SELECT To retrieve the names of activities that have more than three events recording their performance, you need to group the records by the activity and then use the `HAVING` clause to filter those groups that have a count greater than three. Here is the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` This query groups the records by the `activity` column and then filters those groups where the count of records is greater than three. The `HAVING` clause is used to apply the condition on the grouped records.
SELECT To answer the question about activities that were performed more than three times during the processing of declarations, you can use a SQL query similar to the ones provided in the examples. Here's the complete query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` This query will group the records by the `activity` column, count the number of occurrences of each activity, and then filter the results to include only those activities that were performed more than three times.
SELECT To find out which activities had more than three records when processing travel declarations, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` This query groups the records by the `activity` column and counts the number of records for each activity. The `HAVING` clause is then used to filter out activities that have three or fewer records, leaving only those activities that have more than three records.
SELECT To answer the question "What was the last activity performed and what is the resource associated with its performance?" based on the given database schema, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query orders the records in the `event_log` table by the `timestamp` column in descending order (most recent first) and then limits the result to just the first row, which will give you the last activity performed and the resource associated with its performance.
SELECT To report the last activity performed and the resource associated with its performance, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query orders the records in the `event_log` table by the `timestamp` column in descending order, ensuring that the most recent activity is at the top. The `LIMIT 1` clause ensures that only the most recent record is returned.
SELECT To retrieve the last activity performed and the resource associated with its performance, you can use the following SQL query. This query will order the records by the timestamp in descending order and then limit the result to the first row, which represents the most recent activity. ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query works by: 1. Ordering the records in the `event_log` table by the `timestamp` column in descending order (`ORDER BY timestamp DESC`). 2. Limiting the result to only the first row (`LIMIT 1`), which will be the most recent activity due to the descending order.
SELECT To answer the question about the last recorded event and the associated activity and resource, you need to query the `event_log` table to find the event with the latest timestamp. Here is the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query orders the events by the `timestamp` in descending order and then limits the result to the first row, which will be the most recent event. The `SELECT` clause retrieves the `activity` and `resource` associated with that event.

Here is the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query orders the events by the `timestamp` in descending order, ensuring that the most recent event is at the top. The `LIMIT 1` clause then selects only the topmost row, which corresponds to the last recorded event.
SELECT To answer the question "Who was the person who made the last entry in travel declaration processing? This record refers to the performance of which task?", you need to identify the latest timestamp for each travel declaration and then retrieve the corresponding resource (person) and activity (task). Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource, activity FROM event_log WHERE (idcase, timestamp) IN ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ); ``` Explanation: 1. The subquery `SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase` finds the latest timestamp for each travel declaration (`idcase`). 2. The main query then retrieves the `resource` (person) and `activity` (task) for these latest entries by matching the `idcase` and `timestamp` from the subquery. This will give you the person who made the last entry in the travel declaration
SELECT To answer the question "Who was the employee who performed the last activity ever recorded in the travel declaration process and what was that activity?", you need to find the record with the latest timestamp in the `event_log` table. Here's the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT resource, activity FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query orders the records by the `timestamp` column in descending order and then limits the result to the first row, which will be the record with the latest timestamp. This will give you the employee (`resource`) and the activity they performed.
SELECT To answer the question "What are the events and who is responsible for the activity performed in the event, that occurred after an event performing the 'end trip' activity in the same case?", you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table.

SELECT To answer the question "For each activity, return how many cases it was performed in, considering only those cases that ended on March 12, 2018," you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-12' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery to Identify Relevant Cases**: - The subquery `SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-12'` identifies all cases (`idcase`) that ended on March 12, 2018. This is done by grouping the events by `idcase` and checking
SELECT To answer the question "For each activity, return how many process instances each of them was performed in, considering only those process instances that ended on March 12, 2018," you need to identify the process instances that ended on March 12, 2018, and then count the occurrences of each activity within those instances. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql WITH EndedOnMarch12 AS ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-12' ) SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS process_instance_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN (SELECT idcase FROM EndedOnMarch12) GROUP BY activity; ``` Explanation: 1. **Common Table Expression (CTE) `EndedOnMarch12`:** This CTE selects distinct `idcase` values where the activity is 'End trip' and the `timestamp
SELECT To answer the question about the subset of cases completed on March 2, 2018, and to provide a list that associates each activity with the number of cases they appear in, you need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the cases that were completed on March 2, 2018. 2. Count the occurrences of each activity within those cases. Assuming that the completion of a case can be identified by the latest timestamp for that case on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql WITH completed_cases AS ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' ) SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN (SELECT idcase FROM completed_cases) GROUP BY activity ORDER BY case_count
SELECT To answer the final question, we need to provide a list of activities and the number of cases in which each activity appears, considering only the subset of cases that were completed on March 2, 2018. Here's how you can achieve that: 1. First, identify the cases that were completed on March 2, 2018. 2. Then, count the occurrences of each activity within those cases. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql -- Step 1: Identify the cases that were completed on March 2, 2018 WITH completed_cases AS ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' AND activity = 'End trip' ) -- Step 2: Count the occurrences of each activity within those cases SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS number_of_cases FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN (SELECT idcase FROM completed_cases) GROUP
SELECT To answer the question of relating the activities to the number of cases in which they appear, considering only the cases whose last event ended on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-02' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The subquery selects the `idcase` values for cases whose last event (maximum timestamp) ended on March 2, 2018. - `SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-02'` - This groups the events by `id
SELECT To extract information about activities that occurred and the number of cases in which they occurred for cases completed on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS number_of_cases FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-02' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` Explanation: 1. The subquery selects the `idcase` of cases that were completed on March 2, 2018. This is determined by grouping the `event_log` table by `idcase` and using the `HAVING` clause to filter cases where the maximum timestamp (i.e., the last event) is '2018-03-02'. 2. The outer query then selects the `activity` and counts the distinct
SELECT To answer the question "Each of the possible processing actions was performed on how many declarations processed and ended on March 2, 2018?", you need to identify the declarations that ended on March 2, 2018, and then count the occurrences of each activity for those declarations. Assuming that the `idcase` uniquely identifies each declaration and that the `timestamp` indicates when an action was performed, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql -- First, find all declarations that ended on March 2, 2018 WITH declarations_ended_on_march_2 AS ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' ) -- Then, count the occurrences of each activity for those declarations SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN (SELECT idcase FROM declarations_ended_on_march_2) GROUP BY activity ORDER BY activity_count
SELECT To answer the question about how many declarations were performed and ended on March 2, 2018, and how many times each of the different processing actions were performed, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS action_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MIN(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-02' AND MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-02' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: - The subquery selects `idcase` values where the minimum and maximum timestamps (i.e., the start and end times) are both on March 2, 2018. - `strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)` is used to extract the date
SELECT To answer the question "How many cases started with an activity whose label starts with the word 'permit'?", you need to identify the first activity for each case and then check if it starts with 'permit'.

The subquery `first_activities` finds the earliest (first) activity for each case by grouping by `idcase` and selecting the minimum `timestamp`. 2. This subquery is then joined back to the `event_log` table to get the details of the first activity for each case. 3. The `WHERE` clause
SELECT To answer the question of how many cases started with an activity whose label starts with 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will identify the first activity for each case and then check if it starts with 'permit': ```sql WITH FirstActivities AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn FROM event_log ) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FirstActivities WHERE rn = 1 AND activity LIKE 'Permit%'; ``` Explanation: 1. **FirstActivities CTE**: This Common Table Expression (CTE) selects the first activity for each case by using the `ROW_NUMBER()` window function, which assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition of the result set (in this case, partitioned by `idcase` and ordered by `timestamp`). 2. **Main Query**: The main query then
SELECT To answer the question "Given a list of activities whose name starts with 'permit', retrieve how many cases started with one of these activities," you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) as first_event_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) AS first_events JOIN event_log AS el ON first_events.idcase = el.idcase AND first_events.first_event_time = el.timestamp WHERE el.activity LIKE 'Permit%'; ``` Explanation: 1. **Subquery to Find First Event for Each Case**: The subquery `first_events` retrieves the earliest event (`MIN(timestamp)`) for each case (`idcase`). 2. **Join to Get Activity of First Event**: This subquery is then joined with the `event_log` table to get the activity name of the first event for each case. 3. **Filter by Activity Name**

The subquery assigns a row number to each activity within each case (`idcase`), ordered by the `timestamp`. 2. The outer query filters for the first activity in each case (`row_num = 1`) and checks if the activity name starts with 'Permit'. 3. Finally, it counts the distinct cases (`idcase`) that meet this condition.

This helps in identifying the first action for each travel declaration. 2. **Main Query**: The main query filters the results from the
SELECT To answer the question "Which cases have not yet gone through the 'request payment' or 'payment handled' activities?", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Request payment', 'Payment handled') ); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner query selects all distinct `idcase` values where the activity is either 'Request payment' or 'Payment handled'. 2. The outer query selects all distinct `idcase` values from the `event_log` table that are not in the list of `idcase` values returned by the inner query. This effectively filters out all cases that have gone through either of the specified activities.
SELECT To find the process instances that have not yet gone through the 'request payment' or 'payment handled' activities, you can use a query that selects all distinct `idcase` values from the `event_log` table and then filters out those that have either 'request payment' or 'payment handled' activities. Here's how you can do it: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Request payment', 'Payment handled') ); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner query selects all distinct `idcase` values where the activity is either 'Request payment' or 'Payment handled'. 2.

Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Payment handled', 'Request payment') ); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The subquery selects all distinct `idcase` values where the activity is either 'Payment handled' or 'Request payment'. 2. The outer query counts the distinct `idcase` values that are not in the result set of the subquery, meaning these cases have no record of either 'Payment handled' or 'Request payment'.
SELECT To answer the question about which declarations are still pending in relation to both payment request and payment made records, you need to identify the declarations that do not have any 'Request payment' or 'Payment handled' activities recorded.

The subquery (`el2`) selects the maximum timestamp for the 'End trip' activity for each case (`idcase`). This gives us the latest 'End trip' activity for each case. 2. The main query (`el1`) joins the event log with the subquery on `id
SELECT To answer the question "Which declarations received the register of actions even after they registered end of the trip?", you need to identify cases where there are activities logged after the 'End trip' activity. Here's how you can construct the SQL query: 1. Identify the timestamp of the 'End trip' activity for each `idcase`. 2. Find activities for each `idcase` that have a timestamp later than the 'End trip' timestamp. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql WITH EndTripTimestamps AS ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) AS end_trip_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ) SELECT e.idcase, e.activity, e.timestamp FROM event_log e JOIN EndTripTimestamps ett ON e.idcase = ett.idcase WHERE e.timestamp > ett.end_trip_time ORDER BY e.idcase, e.timestamp; ``` Explanation: - The `EndTripTimestamps
SELECT To answer the question "How many cases, to date, have the performance of the 'send reminder' activity as the last recorded event?", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log AS e1 LEFT JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp WHERE e1.activity = 'Send reminder' AND e2.idcase IS NULL; ``` Explanation: - The query uses a self-join on the `event_log` table. - `e1` represents the events where the activity is 'Send reminder'. - `e2` represents any events that occur after the 'Send reminder' event within the same case. - The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that we include all 'Send reminder' events and try to find any subsequent events in the same case. - The condition `e2.idcase IS NULL
SELECT To answer the question "How many cases have the performance of the 'send reminder' activity as the last event recorded to date?", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) AS num_cases FROM event_log e1 LEFT JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp WHERE e1.activity = 'Send reminder' AND e2.idcase IS NULL; ``` Explanation: - `e1` is an alias for the first instance of the `event_log` table. - `e2` is an alias for the second instance of the `event_log` table. - The `LEFT JOIN` is used to join the table with itself on the `idcase` and ensure that `e1.timestamp` is less than `e2.timestamp`. - The `WHERE` clause checks that the activity in `e1` is 'Send reminder'
SELECT To identify how many cases have the 'send reminder' activity as the last recorded event, you can use a subquery to find the latest event for each case and then filter those events to see if they are 'send reminder'. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) AS last_event_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) AS last_events INNER JOIN event_log AS e ON last_events.idcase = e.idcase AND last_events.last_event_time = e.timestamp WHERE e.activity = 'Send reminder'; ``` Explanation: 1. The subquery `last_events` finds the latest event (`MAX(timestamp)`) for each case (`idcase`). 2. This subquery is then joined with the `event_log` table to get the details of these latest events. 3. The `WHERE` clause filters these events to only include those where the activity is 'Send
SELECT To determine how many cases have the 'send reminder' activity recorded as the last occurrence, you can use a subquery to find the latest activity for each case and then filter for those where the latest activity is 'send reminder'. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_cases FROM ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) AS last_timestamp FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) AS latest_events INNER JOIN event_log AS e ON latest_events.idcase = e.idcase AND latest_events.last_timestamp = e.timestamp WHERE e.activity = 'Send reminder'; ``` This query works as follows: 1. The subquery `latest_events` finds the latest timestamp for each case (`idcase`). 2. This result is then joined back to the `event_log` table to get the corresponding activity for the latest timestamp of each case. 3. Finally, the outer query filters these results to count only those cases where
SELECT To answer the question "To date, what is the number of cases in which the most recent event records the performance of 'send reminder'?", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp DESC) AS rn FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE rn = 1 AND activity = 'Send reminder'; ``` Explanation: 1. The subquery assigns a row number (`rn`) to each event within each case (`idcase`), ordered by the timestamp in descending order. This means the most recent event for each case will have `rn = 1`. 2. The outer query filters the subquery to only include rows where `rn = 1` and the activity is 'Send reminder'. 3. Finally, the `COUNT(DISTINCT idcase)` function counts the
SELECT To count how many declarations are stuck in a 'send reminder' activity, you need to identify the cases where the 'send reminder' activity is the last activity recorded. This can be done by comparing the timestamps of activities within each case and checking if the 'send reminder' activity is the most recent one. Here is the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql WITH LastActivity AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp DESC) AS rn FROM event_log ) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM LastActivity WHERE rn = 1 AND activity = 'Send reminder'; ``` Explanation: 1. The `LastActivity` common table expression (CTE) selects the `idcase`, `activity`, and `timestamp` from the `event_log` table and assigns a row number (`rn`) to each activity within a case, ordered by the timestamp in descending order. This means
SELECT To answer the question "What are the resources that were not working on March 31, 2018?", you can use the following SQL query. This query will first find all the resources that were working on March 31, 2018, and then use a subquery to find all resources that are not in that list. ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE resource IS NOT NULL AND resource NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-31' ); ``` Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-31'`) retrieves all distinct resources that were working on March 31, 2018. 2. The outer query (`SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE resource IS NOT NULL AND resource NOT IN (...)`) retrieves all distinct resources from the `event_log` table that are not in the list
SELECT To answer the question "What resources were not allocated to any event on March 31, 2018?", you need to identify resources that do not appear in the event log for that specific date. Assuming you have a list of all possible resources in another table called `resources`, you can use a `LEFT JOIN` to find resources that are not present in the event log for the specified date. Here is the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql -- Assuming there is a table called 'resources' that lists all possible resources CREATE TABLE "resources" ( "resource" TEXT COLLATE NOCASE, PRIMARY KEY("resource") ); -- Query to find resources not allocated to any event on March 31, 2018 SELECT r.resource FROM resources r LEFT JOIN event_log e ON r.resource = e.resource AND DATE(e.timestamp) = '2018-03-31' WHERE e.resource IS NULL; ``` Explanation: 1. The `LEFT JOIN`
SELECT To list all resources that were not associated with events performed on March 31, 2018, you can use a subquery to find all resources that were associated with events on that date and then use a `NOT IN` clause to filter them out from the list of all resources. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE resource IS NOT NULL AND resource NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp) = '2018-03-31' ); ``` Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp) = '2018-03-31'`) retrieves all distinct resources that were associated with events on March 31, 2018. 2. The outer query selects all distinct resources from the `event_log` table that are not in the list of

SELECT To answer the question "In which cases was there rework?" based on the provided database schema and the context of the previous SQL examples, you can use a similar approach to identify cases where the same activity was performed consecutively. Here's the SQL query to find such cases: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = next_activity; ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner query uses the `LEAD` window function to look ahead to the next activity within the same case (`idcase`), ordered by the timestamp. 2. The outer query selects distinct `idcase` values where the current activity is the same as the next activity, indicating rework. This will give you a list of cases (`idcase`) where there was rework
SELECT To retrieve cases where rework situations occurred, you can use a similar approach to the previous examples. Specifically, you need to identify cases where the same activity was performed consecutively. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = next_activity; ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner query uses the `LEAD` window function to look ahead to the next activity within the same case (`idcase`), ordered by the timestamp. 2. The outer query selects distinct `idcase` values where the current activity is the same as the next activity, indicating a rework situation. This will give you the list of cases where rework situations occurred.
SELECT To report which cases went through rework situations, you need to identify cases where the same activity was performed consecutively. This can be achieved by using the `LEAD` window function to compare each activity with the next one in the sequence for each case. Here's the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = next_activity; ``` Explanation: 1. The subquery selects the `idcase`, `activity`, and the next activity (`next_activity`) for each case using the `LEAD` function. 2. The `LEAD` function is partitioned by `idcase` and ordered by `timestamp` to ensure the activities are in the correct sequence. 3. The outer query selects distinct `idcase` values where
SELECT To determine in which declarations there was rework, we need to identify cases where the same activity was performed more than once for the same declaration (`idcase`). This implies that an activity was repeated, indicating rework. Here is the SQL query to find such declarations: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ``` Explanation: - `GROUP BY idcase, activity`: This groups the records by both the declaration (`idcase`) and the activity. - `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`: This filters the groups to only include those where the same activity was performed more than once for the same declaration, indicating rework.
SELECT To answer the question "In which declarations did we have problems with rework?" based on the provided database schema and the context of the previous queries, we need to identify cases where the same activity was performed more than once for the same `idcase`.

Here is the SQL query to find such cases: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, COUNT(*) as activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity HAVING activity_count > 1 ) AS rework_cases; ``` Explanation: 1. The inner query groups the events by `idcase` and `activity` and counts the occurrences of each activity within each case. 2. The `HAVING activity_count > 1` clause filters out the activities that occurred more than once within the same case, indicating rework. 3. The outer query selects distinct `idcase` values from the filtered results to
SELECT To answer the question "In which declarations was the same intervention performed more than once?", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ``` This query groups the records by `idcase` and `activity`, and then uses the `HAVING` clause to filter out groups where the count of activities is greater than one. This will give you the `idcase` values where the same intervention (activity) was performed more than once.
SELECT To answer the question "In which cases were activities of the same type performed consecutively?" you can use a SQL query that checks for consecutive rows with the same activity within the same case. This can be achieved by using window functions to compare the current row's activity with the previous row's activity within the same case.

The subquery generates a result set with the current activity and the previous activity for each row. 3. The outer query filters the results to find cases where the current activity is the same as the previous activity. 4. `DISTINCT` is used to ensure that each case is listed only once.
SELECT To report which cases have undergone rework situations, with sequences of performance of the same activity, you need to identify cases where the same activity appears more than once in sequence for a given case. This can be achieved by using window functions to compare the current activity with the previous activity within the same case.

SELECT To determine which employees are supervisors, you would typically need to have a table or some form of data that explicitly lists the roles or positions of employees. However, based on the provided schema and the context of the previous queries, it seems that the role of an employee might be inferred from the activities they perform. Given that supervisors are involved in activities like 'Declaration final approved by supervisor' and 'Declaration approved by supervisor', you can infer the list of supervisors by identifying the unique employees who have performed these activities. Here is the SQL query to find the employees who are supervisors based on the activities they have performed: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Declaration final approved by supervisor', 'Declaration approved by supervisor'); ``` This query selects distinct employees (`resource`) who have performed either of the activities associated with the supervisor role.
SELECT To answer the question "Which employees took on the role of supervisors during the processing of declarations?", you need to identify the specific activities that are associated with the role of a supervisor. Assuming that the role of a supervisor is associated with specific activities (e.g., "Supervision", "Review", "Approval"), you can filter the `event_log` table based on these activities. Here is an example SQL query that assumes the activities associated with supervisors are "Supervision", "Review", and "Approval": ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Supervision', 'Review', 'Approval'); ``` This query will return a list of distinct employees (resources) who performed any of the activities associated with the role of a supervisor. If the activities associated with supervisors are different, you should replace the values in the `IN` clause with the appropriate activity names.
SELECT To answer the question "Which employees are responsible for the budget?" based on the given database schema, you would need to identify the specific activities related to budget responsibilities. Assuming that activities related to the budget include terms like "budget" or similar, you can filter the `event_log` table for such activities and then group by the `resource` (employee) to get the list of employees responsible for the budget. Here is an example SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%budget%' ``` This query selects distinct employees (`resource`) from the `event_log` table where the `activity` column contains the word "budget". Adjust the `LIKE` clause as necessary to match the specific activities related to budget responsibilities in your dataset.
SELECT To answer the question "Which employees took on the role of budget owners during the processing of declarations?", you can use a SQL query similar to the one used to find employees who took on the role of supervisors. Assuming that the role of budget owners is indicated by the presence of the word "budget owner" in the `activity` column, you can use the following query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(resource) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%budget owner%' ``` This query selects distinct employees (resources) from the `event_log` table where the `activity` column contains the phrase "budget owner". This will give you a list of employees who took on the role of budget owners during the processing of declarations.
