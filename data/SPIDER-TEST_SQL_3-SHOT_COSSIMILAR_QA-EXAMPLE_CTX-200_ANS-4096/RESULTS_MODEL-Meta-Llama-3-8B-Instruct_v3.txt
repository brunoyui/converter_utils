SELECT Based on the provided SQL examples and database schema, I'll answer the question: What activities involve a permit or declaration? The answer can be found by combining the SQL examples: 1. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' shows that permit-related activities are present in the event log. 2. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Declaration%' (not provided, but implied) would show that declaration-related activities are also present in the event log. To combine these, we can use the OR operator: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' OR activity LIKE '%Declaration%' This query will return all rows from the event_log table where the activity column contains either the string 'Permit' or 'Declaration' (case-insensitive).
SELECT Based on the provided SQL examples and database schema, I'll answer the questions: 1. Actions related to permits were performed during the processing of which declarations? The query select idcase from event_log where activity like 'Permit%' GROUP BY idcase HAVING count(*) > 1 suggests that the idcase values that have more than one permit-related activity (i.e., activity column contains a string that starts with 'Permit') are the ones that were processed during the permit-related actions. 2. What characterizes the interventions that generate a permit during the processing of a declaration? The query SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' returns all rows from the event_log table where the activity column contains a string that includes the word 'Permit'. This suggests that the interventions that generate a permit during the processing of a declaration are those that have an activity value that includes the word 'Permit'. 3. The performances of the 'permit' activity are associated with which events? How are these events characterized? The query SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' returns all rows from the event_log table where the activity column contains a string that includes the word 'Permit'. This suggests that the events associated with the 'permit' activity are those that have an activity value that includes the word 'Permit'. 4. Which of the activities involve 'permit' or 'declaration' actions? The query SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' OR activity LIKE '%Declaration%' returns all rows from the event_log table where the activity column contains a string that includes the word 'Permit' or 'Declaration'. This suggests that the activities that involve 'permit' or 'declaration' actions are those that have an activity value that includes either the word 'Permit' or 'Declaration'.

SELECT Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN activity ='start trip' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS start_trip_count, COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'end trip' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS end_trip_count FROM event_log; This query uses a technique called "conditional aggregation" to count the number of occurrences of'start trip' and 'end trip' activities. The CASE statement checks if the activity column matches the desired value, and if so, returns a value of 1. If not, it returns NULL. The COUNT function then counts the number of non-NULL values for each condition.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('start trip', 'end trip');
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('start trip', 'end trip');
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Start trip', 'End trip')
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as event_count FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('start trip', 'end trip') GROUP BY activity
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity; This query will return two rows, one for the'start trip' activity and one for the 'end trip' activity, with the count of occurrences for each activity.

SELECT Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, I'll answer the question: /* Answer the following: Which employees are responsible for the budget? */ To find the employees responsible for the budget, we can use the following SQL query: SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%budget%'; This query will return a list of employees who have been involved in activities related to the budget. Note: The LIKE operator is used with the wildcard character % to match any characters before and after the word "budget" in the activity column. The DISTINCT keyword is used to return only unique employee resources.
SELECT DISTINCT(resource) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%budget owner%'
