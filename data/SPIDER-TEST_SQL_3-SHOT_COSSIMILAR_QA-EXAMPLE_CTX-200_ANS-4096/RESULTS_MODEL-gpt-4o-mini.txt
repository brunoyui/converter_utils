Here’s the SQL query you would use: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT resource) AS unique_resource_count FROM event_log; ``` This query will return a single value representing the number of distinct resources present in the `event_log` table.
SELECT To report how many different people appear in the event log, you would typically need to count the distinct values in the column that represents people. However, based on the provided schema, there is no explicit column for "people." If we assume that the "resource" column represents different people or entities involved in the events, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT resource) AS different_people_count FROM event_log; ``` This query counts the number of unique entries in the "resource" column, which would give you the number of different people (or resources) that appear in the event log. If there is a different column that represents people, you would replace "resource" with the appropriate column name.
SELECT To report how many employees were involved in processing the declarations, you can use the following SQL query. This query counts the distinct resources (employees) in the `event_log` table: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT resource) AS number_of_employees FROM event_log; ``` ### Explanation: - `COUNT(DISTINCT resource)`: This counts the number of unique employees (resources) that appear in the `event_log`. - `AS number_of_employees`: This gives a name to the resulting count for clarity in the output. This query will return a single value representing the total number of distinct employees involved in processing the declarations.
SELECT To determine how many employees worked on processing the declarations, you can use a SQL query that counts the distinct resources (employees) associated with the processing activities in the `event_log` table.

SELECT To retrieve event data related to the performance of the 'start trip' or 'request payment' activities from the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' OR activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is either 'Start trip' or 'Request payment'.
SELECT To retrieve information associated with events related to 'start trip' or 'request payment' activities from the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' OR activity = 'Request payment' ORDER BY timestamp, resource; ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is either 'Start trip' or 'Request payment', and it orders the results by `timestamp` and `resource` in ascending order.
SELECT To list the data relating to the events associated with the activity instances named 'start trip' or 'request payment', you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Start trip', 'Request payment'); ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is either 'Start trip' or 'Request payment'. The `IN` clause allows you to specify multiple values to match against the `activity` column.
SELECT To retrieve information associated with the actions that mark the start of a trip and the actions that indicate that a payment request has been made, you can use a `UNION` to combine the results of two separate `SELECT` statements. Each `SELECT` will filter the `event_log` table for the relevant activities. Here's how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, resource, cost FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' UNION ALL SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, resource, cost FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` ### Explanation: - The first `SELECT` retrieves all records where the activity is 'Start trip', including the `idcase`, `activity`, `timestamp`, `resource`, and `cost`. - The second `SELECT` retrieves all records where the activity is 'Request payment', with the same columns. - `UNION ALL` is used to combine the
SELECT To find the most frequent activities in the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY activity_count DESC LIMIT 1; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS activity_count**: This selects the activity and counts how many times each activity appears in the log. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **GROUP BY activity**: This groups the results by the activity, so that the count is calculated for each unique activity. - **ORDER BY activity_count DESC**: This orders the results in descending order based on the count of activities, so the most frequent activities appear first. - **LIMIT 1**: This limits the results to only the most frequent activity.

Here's the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT idcase, strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp)) AS duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - `idcase`: This selects the case identifier. - `strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp))`: This converts the maximum timestamp of each case to seconds since the Unix epoch. - `strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp))`: This converts the minimum timestamp of each case to seconds since the Unix epoch. - The difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps gives the duration of each case in seconds. - `GROUP BY idcase`: This groups the results by each case, allowing the calculation of the duration for each individual case.
SELECT To calculate the approximate total time for each case in the `event_log` table, you can follow a similar approach to the previous examples. You will need to calculate the duration between the first and last events for each case. Here's how you can do it: ```sql WITH RankedEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) SELECT idcase, (strftime('%s', end_time) - strftime('%s', start_time)) AS total_duration FROM RankedEvents; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (Common Table Expression) - RankedEvents**: This part of the query groups the events by `idcase` and calculates the minimum (`start_time`) and maximum (`end_time`) timestamps for each case. 2. **Final SELECT**: This part selects the `
SELECT To calculate the approximate duration of each case in the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query. This query will find the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps for each case, which gives you the total duration of each case: ```sql SELECT idcase, strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp)) AS duration_seconds FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - `idcase`: This is the identifier for each case. - `MAX(timestamp)`: This retrieves the latest timestamp for each case. - `MIN(timestamp)`: This retrieves the earliest timestamp for each case. - `strftime('%s', ...)`: This function converts the timestamp into seconds since the Unix epoch, allowing for easy subtraction to calculate the duration in seconds. - `GROUP BY idcase`: This groups the results by each case, so the calculations are done for each individual case. This
SELECT To calculate how long each case lasts, you can find the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps for each case. This will give you the duration of each case. Here’s how you can write the SQL query for that: ```sql SELECT idcase, (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)) AS case_duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` In this query: - We select the `idcase` and calculate the duration by subtracting the minimum timestamp from the maximum timestamp for each case. - We group the results by `idcase` to ensure we get the duration for each individual case. Make sure that the `timestamp` column is in a format that allows for subtraction (e.g., a datetime format). If you're using SQLite, you might need to convert the timestamps to a format that can be subtracted, such as using `strftime` to convert them to seconds or another appropriate unit. Here's an example using
SELECT To report the duration of each case in the `event_log` table, you can calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps for each case. This will give you the total duration of activities performed in each case. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - `MAX(timestamp)` retrieves the latest timestamp for each case. - `MIN(timestamp)` retrieves the earliest timestamp for each case. - The difference between these two values gives the duration of the case. - `GROUP BY idcase` groups the results by each unique case identifier, allowing you to calculate the duration for each case individually. Make sure that the `timestamp` column is in a format that supports subtraction (like a datetime format). If the database system you are using requires a specific function to calculate the difference between timestamps, you
SELECT To calculate the duration of processing for each declaration, you can follow a similar approach to the previous examples. You will need to find the start and end timestamps for each declaration and then compute the difference between them. Here's a SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql WITH RankedEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp FROM event_log ), StartEndTimes AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(next_timestamp) AS end_time FROM RankedEvents WHERE activity IN ('Start processing', 'End processing') -- Adjust these activities based on your actual activity names GROUP BY idcase ) SELECT idcase, strftime('%s', end_time) - strftime('%s', start_time) AS
SELECT To find the cases that had the same resource allocated for all performances of their activities, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` This query groups the records by `idcase` and `resource`, and then uses the `HAVING` clause to filter the results to only include those cases where there is only one distinct resource associated with that case. This means that all activities for those cases were handled by the same resource.
SELECT To find the cases that had the same resource allocated to all their activities, along with the resource used, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **SELECT idcase, resource**: This selects the case ID and the resource used for each case. 2. **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. 3. **GROUP BY idcase, resource**: This groups the results by case ID and resource, allowing us to analyze the data for each case and its associated resource. 4. **HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1**: This condition ensures that we only include cases where there is only one distinct resource associated with all activities in that case. This query will return the cases that had the same resource allocated to all their activities,
SELECT To find the cases that had the same resource allocated for all performances of their activities, along with the resource used, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1 ``` This query groups the records by `idcase` and `resource`, and then uses the `HAVING` clause to filter the results to only include those cases where there is only one distinct resource associated with that case. This means that all activities within that case were handled by the same resource. If you want to ensure that you are also getting the cases where the resource is the same across all activities, you can modify the query slightly to ensure that you are counting the distinct resources for each case: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1
SELECT To list the cases and the resource in which all activities are handled by the same resource, you can use a SQL query that groups the data by `idcase` and checks if there is only one distinct resource for each case. Here’s how you can write that query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` However, the above query will return multiple rows if there are multiple resources that handled the same case. To ensure that you only get the cases where all activities are handled by the same resource, you can use a subquery to first identify those cases: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` In this query: - We group by `idcase` to aggregate the data for each case. - We use `HAV

If there is only one distinct resource for a case, it means all activities for that case were performed by that resource. This
SELECT To find the cases and the resource where all activities are handled by the same resource, you can use a SQL query that groups the data by `idcase` and checks if there is only one distinct resource for each case. Here’s how you can write that query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` However, to ensure that you get the correct resource associated with each case, you might want to use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to first identify the cases with a single resource. Here’s an example using a subquery: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` In this query: - We group by `idcase` to aggregate the data for each case. - We use `HAV

This query will return a list of cases along with the resource that handled all activities for those cases.
SELECT To identify cases where all activities have been allocated to the same resource, you can use a query that groups the data by `idcase` and checks that there is only one distinct resource for each case. You can then select both the `idcase` and the corresponding resource. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` However, to ensure that you get the resource associated with each case, you can use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to first find the cases with a single resource and then join back to get the resource name.

SELECT To answer the question of how long it takes from the start of processing a declaration until the end of the trip is recorded, or until it is rejected by an employee, or until payment is made, you can use a SQL query that combines the necessary logic to calculate the time differences based on the events logged in the `event_log` table. Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql WITH StartTimes AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start processing declaration' -- Assuming this is the activity that indicates the start GROUP BY idcase ), EndTrip AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS end_trip_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ), Rejected AS ( SELECT idcase,
SELECT To retrieve event data associated with 'request payment' activities from the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table where the `activity` column matches 'Request payment'. This will give you all the event data related to that specific activity.
SELECT To check if there are records of the 'request payment' activity in the event log and to show the associated event data, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'Request payment'. If there are any records matching this condition, they will be displayed as the result of the query. If no records exist, the result will be an empty set.
SELECT To answer the question about whether there are declarations for which a payment request has already been made, and to supply the data from these requests, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query retrieves all records from the `event_log` table where the activity is 'Request payment'. This will provide you with the details of all payment requests that have been made, including the associated `idcase`, `timestamp`, `resource`, and `cost`. If you want to filter the results to only include unique declarations (i.e., distinct `idcase` values) that have a payment request, you can modify the query as follows: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase, timestamp, resource, cost FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This will give you a list of unique declarations along with their corresponding details for each payment request made.
SELECT To answer the question about whether there are interventions that request payment for declarations and to report the details of the performance of this intervention, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, resource, cost FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query selects the `idcase`, `activity`, `timestamp`, `resource`, and `cost` columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'Request payment'. This will provide you with the details of all interventions that involve requesting payment for declarations. If you want to further analyze or filter the results, you can modify the query accordingly. For example, if you want to see only those requests that have a cost associated with them, you can add a condition to check for non-null costs: ```sql SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, resource, cost FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' AND cost IS NOT NULL;

However, if we assume that each activity has a corresponding start and end entry in the `event_log`, you can calculate the average duration as follows: 1. First, you would need to identify the start and end timestamps for each activity. 2. Then, calculate the duration for each activity. 3. Finally, compute the average duration for each activity.

Assuming that the events are logged in chronological order and that each activity has a corresponding end event, you could do something like this: ```sql SELECT start.activity, AVG(julianday(end.timestamp) - julianday(start.timestamp)) AS average_duration FROM event_log AS start JOIN event_log AS end ON start.idcase = end.idcase AND start.activity = end.activity AND start.timestamp < end
SELECT To calculate the average duration of each activity, you first need to ensure that you have a way to determine the duration of each activity. This typically involves having a start and end timestamp for each activity. Assuming that your `event_log` table contains only the start timestamps of activities, you would need to join it with itself to find the end timestamps. However, if you have a way to determine the duration (for example, if you have a separate table or if the duration is calculated based on the timestamps), you can use the following SQL query to calculate the average duration of each activity: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(duration) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT activity, (julianday(end_timestamp) - julianday(start_timestamp)) * 24 * 60 AS duration FROM event_log WHERE end_timestamp IS NOT NULL ) AS durations GROUP BY activity; ``` In this query: - Replace `end_timestamp` and `start_timestamp` with
SELECT To report each activity's average duration, you would need to have a way to calculate the duration of each activity. Assuming that the `event_log` table contains multiple entries for the same activity and that the duration can be calculated based on the timestamps of the events, you would typically need to join the table with itself or use a window function to calculate the duration between consecutive events of the same activity. However, if we assume that the `event_log` table has a `duration` column that records the duration of each activity directly, the SQL query would look like this: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(cost) AS average_duration FROM event_log GROUP BY activity; ``` If you do not have a `duration` column and need to calculate the duration based on timestamps, you would need to do something like this: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(duration) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT activity, (julianday(next_event.timestamp) - julianday
SELECT To report the average duration of each activity, you would typically need to have a way to calculate the duration of each activity. This usually involves having a start and end timestamp for each activity. However, based on the provided schema, it seems that you only have a single timestamp for each event in the `event_log` table. If you had a way to determine the duration of each activity (for example, if you had a separate table with start and end timestamps), you could calculate the average duration. Assuming you have such a mechanism, the SQL query might look something like this: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(duration) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT activity, (julianday(end_timestamp) - julianday(start_timestamp)) * 24 * 60 * 60 AS duration FROM activity_durations -- This is a hypothetical table containing start and end timestamps ) AS durations GROUP BY activity; ``` However, since your current schema does not provide
SELECT To report how long each activity lasts on average, you would typically need to have a way to calculate the duration of each activity. This usually involves having a start and end timestamp for each activity. However, based on the provided schema, it seems that there is only a single timestamp for each event in the `event_log` table. If you had a way to identify the start and end of each activity (for example, if there were two entries for each activity: one for the start and one for the end), you could calculate the duration. Assuming you have such a structure, here’s how you might write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(duration) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT start.activity, (end.timestamp - start.timestamp) AS duration FROM event_log AS start JOIN event_log AS end ON start.idcase = end.idcase WHERE start.activity = 'Activity
SELECT To calculate the average duration of each type of intervention carried out during the processing of declarations, you can use the following SQL query. This query will compute the duration for each type of activity by finding the time difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps for each activity type, and then it will calculate the average duration for each activity type. Here's the SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(MAX_TIMESTAMP - MIN_TIMESTAMP) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT activity, MAX(strftime('%s', timestamp)) AS MAX_TIMESTAMP, MIN(strftime('%s', timestamp)) AS MIN_TIMESTAMP FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity ) AS activity_durations GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query groups the `event_log` by `idcase` and `activity`, calculating the maximum and minimum timestamps for each activity within each case. This gives us
SELECT To find the cases with the highest cost from the `event_log` table, you can use a similar approach as in the previous examples. You would first need to determine the maximum cost and then select the cases that have that maximum cost. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log); ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT DISTINCT idcase`: This selects unique case identifiers (`idcase`) from the `event_log` table. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)`: This condition filters the results to only include cases where the cost is equal to the maximum cost found in the `event_log` table. This query will return all unique cases that have the highest cost recorded in the `event_log`.
SELECT To find the cases with the highest cost in the `event_log` table, you can use a query that groups the records by `idcase`, sums the costs for each case, and then selects the case(s) with the maximum total cost. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING total_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_cost) FROM (SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **SUM(cost)**: This aggregates the costs for each case. 2. **GROUP BY idcase**: This groups the results by each unique case identifier. 3. **HAVING total_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_cost) ...)**: This filters the results to only include the case(s) with the highest total cost. 4. The inner query calculates the maximum total cost
SELECT To find the cases that have the maximum cost recorded in the `event_log`, you can use a subquery to first determine the maximum cost and then select the cases that have that maximum cost. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The subquery `(SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)` retrieves the highest cost from the `event_log`. 2. The outer query selects the `idcase` from the `event_log` where the `cost` matches the maximum cost found in the subquery. This will return all cases that have the maximum cost recorded in the event log.
SELECT To present cases whose costs are equal to the highest cost, you can use a similar approach as in the previous examples. You will need to select from the `event_log` table and filter based on the maximum cost. However, since you want to present cases, you might want to group by the `idcase` field to ensure you get unique cases. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING total_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_cost) FROM (SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query calculates the total cost for each case by summing the costs grouped by `idcase`. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query selects the `idcase` and its total cost, filtering to only include those cases where
SELECT To present cases whose total costs are equal to the maximum cost recorded in the event log, you can use a subquery to first find the maximum total cost and then filter the cases that match this cost. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING total_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_cost) FROM (SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query calculates the total cost for each case and finds the maximum of these total costs. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query groups the records by `idcase`, calculates the total cost for each case, and uses the `HAVING` clause to filter cases where the total cost matches the maximum total cost found in the inner query. This will give you the cases whose total
SELECT To present the highest cost cases from the `event_log` table, you can use a similar approach as in the previous examples. You would want to select the records that have the maximum cost. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log); ``` This query retrieves all columns from the `event_log` table for the records that have the highest cost, which is determined by the subquery that selects the maximum cost from the same table. If you want to specifically present the highest cost cases based on the `idcase` column, you might want to group by `idcase` and then select the maximum cost for each case. Here’s an example of how you could do that: ```sql SELECT idcase, MAX(cost) AS max_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` This query will give you a list of cases along with their highest associated costs
SELECT To find the declarations that represent the highest cost to the university, you can use the following SQL query. This query will group the records by `idcase`, sum the costs for each case, and then order the results to find the highest total cost. ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log WHERE cost IS NOT NULL GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY total_cost DESC LIMIT 1; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost`: This selects the `idcase` and calculates the total cost for each case. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE cost IS NOT NULL`: This filters out any records where the cost is null, ensuring that only records with actual costs are considered. - `GROUP BY idcase`: This groups the results by `idcase`, allowing the `SUM` function to calculate the total cost for each case
SELECT To retrieve the events with the highest cost from the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table for the events that have the highest costs: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost IN ( SELECT DISTINCT cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5 ) ORDER BY cost DESC; ``` This query does the following: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5`) retrieves the top 5 distinct costs from the `event_log` table, ordered from highest to lowest. 2. The outer query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the cost matches any of the costs returned by the inner query. 3. Finally, the results are ordered by cost in descending order to show the highest-cost events first. If you want to ensure that you only get the top 5 highest-cost
SELECT To find the events with the highest cost, you can use a query that orders the events by cost in descending order and limits the results to the top entries. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5; ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table, orders the results by the `cost` column in descending order, and limits the output to the top 5 highest-cost events. If you want to ensure that you only get unique costs (in case there are multiple events with the same cost), you can use a subquery to first get the distinct costs and then join back to the original table. Here’s an example of that approach: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost IN ( SELECT DISTINCT cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5 ); ``` This will give you
SELECT To find the events that have the maximum cost in the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query `(SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)` retrieves the maximum cost from the `event_log` table. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `cost` matches the maximum cost obtained from the subquery. This will return all events that have the highest cost.

SELECT To present the highest-cost events from the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query. This query retrieves all columns for the events with the highest costs, sorted in descending order, and limits the results to the top five: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5; ``` This query will give you the five events with the highest costs, along with all their associated information. If you want to ensure that you only get unique costs, you can use a subquery to first select the distinct highest costs, but in this case, since you're limiting the results to five, the above query is sufficient.
SELECT To present the events whose cost amounts are the highest, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table and orders the results by the `cost` in descending order, limiting the results to the top five highest-cost events: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5; ``` This query retrieves the five events with the highest costs from the `event_log` table. If you want to ensure that you only get unique costs, you can use a subquery to first get the distinct highest costs and then join it back to the main table. However, the above query is sufficient for most use cases where you simply want the top five events by cost.

SELECT To find trips that have either started or ended without any payment requests or payments made, you can use a combination of `UNION` and `EXCEPT` to filter the relevant cases. Here's how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Start trip', 'End trip') EXCEPT SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Request Payment', 'Payment handled'); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **First Part**: The first `SELECT` statement retrieves all unique `idcase` values where the activity is either 'Start trip' or 'End trip'. 2. **Second Part**: The second `SELECT` statement retrieves all unique `idcase` values where the activity is either 'Request Payment' or 'Payment handled'. 3. **EXCEPT**: This operator is used to return the `idcase` values from the first part that do not appear in the second part
SELECT To list all events that are not associated with any resources, you can use a query that filters for events where the `resource` field is either `NULL` or an empty string. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE resource IS NULL OR resource = ''; ``` This query retrieves all columns from the `event_log` table where the `resource` column does not have a valid value (i.e., it is either `NULL` or an empty string). If you want to select specific columns, you can replace the `*` with the desired column names.
SELECT To list events in which resources were not used or reported, you would typically want to identify events that do not have any associated resources. However, based on the provided schema, it seems that every event in the `event_log` table has a `resource` field. Therefore, if you want to find events where the `resource` is NULL or empty, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE resource IS NULL OR resource = ''; ``` This query will return all rows from the `event_log` table where the `resource` field is either NULL or an empty string, indicating that no resources were associated with those events. If you are looking for a different interpretation of "events in which resources were not used or reported," please provide more context or clarify the requirements.

SELECT To find the events that no resources have been associated with, you can use a query that selects events from the `event_log` table where the `resource` field is either NULL or an empty string. However, since the `event_log` table does not have a separate events table, we can assume that an event is defined by the `activity` field. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to find events that have no associated resources: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource IS NULL OR resource = ''; ``` This query selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table where the `resource` is either NULL or an empty string, indicating that those events have not been associated with any resources. If you want to ensure that you are only looking at events that have been logged but have no associated resources, you can also use a subquery to filter out activities that have at least one associated resource: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM
SELECT To retrieve events with which no resource was associated, you would typically look for records in the `event_log` table where the `resource` field is either NULL or an empty string. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE resource IS NULL OR resource = ''; ``` This query will return all rows from the `event_log` table where the `resource` column does not have an associated value.
SELECT To create a report of all interventions in which employees were not allocated, or the allocation was not reported, you can query the `event_log` table for records where the `resource` field is either NULL or an empty string.

This query will group the actions by the employee (resource) and the activity they performed, allowing you to see the distinct types of actions for each employee. ```sql SELECT resource, activity FROM event_log GROUP BY resource, activity ORDER BY resource, activity; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT resource, activity**: This selects the employee (resource) and the type of action (activity) they performed. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **GROUP BY resource, activity**: This groups the results by both the employee and the action type, ensuring that each combination is unique in the result set. - **ORDER BY resource, activity**: This orders the results first by employee and then by action type for better readability. This query will give you a list of each employee along with the distinct types of
SELECT To find out which activities the resource "Virginia" has not yet acted in, you can use a query that selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table and then excludes the activities that "Virginia" has already acted in. This can be achieved using a `LEFT JOIN` or a `NOT IN` clause. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` Alternatively, you can use a `LEFT JOIN` approach: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e.activity FROM event_log e LEFT JOIN ( SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ) v ON e.activity = v.activity WHERE v.activity IS NULL; ``` Both queries will return the list of activities in which the resource "Virginia" has not acted.
SELECT To list the labels of activities that the Virginia resource has not yet acted on, you can use a query that first identifies all distinct activities in the `event_log` table and then excludes those activities that the Virginia resource has already acted on. Here's how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query selects all distinct activities that the resource 'Virginia' has acted on. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table that are not in the list returned by the inner query, effectively giving you the activities that Virginia has not acted on. This will provide you with a list of activities that the specified resource (Virginia) has not yet participated in.
SELECT To find the activities that Virginia has not yet been associated with, you can use a query that selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table and then excludes those activities that have been associated with Virginia. This can be achieved using a `LEFT JOIN` or a `NOT IN` clause. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner query selects all distinct activities that have been associated with the resource 'Virginia'. 2. The outer query selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table. 3. The `WHERE` clause in the outer query filters out any activities that are present in the result of the inner query, effectively giving you the activities that Virginia has not been associated with.
SELECT To find out which activities have no records of employee Virginia's activities, you can use a query that identifies all distinct activities from the `event_log` table and then checks which of those activities do not have any entries for Virginia. This can be achieved using a `LEFT JOIN` or a `NOT EXISTS` clause. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner query selects all activities that Virginia has performed. 2. The outer query selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table. 3. The `WHERE` clause in the outer query filters out any activities that Virginia has already performed, leaving only those activities that have no records for her. Alternatively, you could also use a `LEFT JOIN` approach: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e.activity FROM event
SELECT To retrieve the labels of activities that have not yet been associated with the employee Virginia, you can use a query that selects activities from the `event_log` table where the resource is not 'Virginia'. You can achieve this by using a subquery to find all activities associated with Virginia and then using that result to filter out those activities from the main query. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN (SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia'); ``` This query does the following: 1. The subquery `(SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia')` retrieves all activities associated with the employee Virginia. 2. The main query selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table that are not in the list of activities associated with Virginia. This way, you get a list of activities that have not been associated with Virginia.
SELECT To determine which actions Virginia does not yet have experience in, you would typically want to find all possible actions and then exclude those actions that Virginia has already performed. Assuming that the actions are represented by the `activity` column in the `event_log` table, you can achieve this with a query that uses a `LEFT JOIN` or a `NOT IN` clause. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia'`) retrieves all the activities that Virginia has already performed. 2. The outer query (`SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log`) retrieves all distinct activities from the `event_log`. 3. The `WHERE activity NOT IN (...)` clause filters out the activities that Virginia has already performed, leaving you with the
SELECT To calculate the average cost of cases that went through the 'rejected' activity, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%rejected%' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%rejected%'`) retrieves all unique case IDs that have gone through an activity containing the word 'rejected'. 2. The outer query calculates the average cost (`AVG(cost)`) of all records in the `event_log` table where the `idcase` is in the list of cases returned by the inner query. This will give you the average cost of all cases that have gone through the 'rejected' activity.
SELECT To calculate the average cost of cases that went through the 'rejected' activity, you can use the following SQL query. This query first identifies the cases that have the 'rejected' activity and then calculates the average cost for those cases. ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected'`) retrieves a list of unique case IDs (`idcase`) that have the 'rejected' activity. 2. The outer query calculates the average cost (`AVG(cost)`) from the `event_log` table, but only for those cases that are included in the list generated by the inner query. This way, you ensure that only the costs associated with cases that have gone through the 'rejected' activity are considered in the average calculation
SELECT To calculate the average cost of cases that include at least one instance of the 'rejected' activity, you can use the following SQL query. This query first identifies the cases that have at least one 'rejected' activity, then calculates the total cost for those cases, and finally computes the average cost. ```sql SELECT AVG(total_cost) FROM ( SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected' ) GROUP BY idcase ) AS case_costs; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: - The inner query selects distinct `idcase` values from the `event_log` where the activity is 'rejected'. This gives us a list of cases that have at least one 'rejected' activity. 2. **Middle Query**: - The middle query calculates the
SELECT To report the mean cost of cases that include at least one instance of the 'rejected' activity, you can use the following SQL query. This query first identifies the cases that have at least one 'rejected' activity and then calculates the average cost for those cases. ```sql SELECT AVG(total_cost) AS mean_cost FROM ( SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%rejected%' ) GROUP BY idcase ) AS case_costs; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query selects distinct `idcase` values from the `event_log` where the `activity` contains 'rejected'. This gives us a list of cases that have at least one 'rejected' activity. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query calculates the total cost for each of those
SELECT To filter the cases that went through the 'rejected' activity and then calculate the mean of their costs, you can use a subquery to first identify the cases that have the 'rejected' activity. Then, you can calculate the mean cost for those cases. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected'`) retrieves all unique case IDs (`idcase`) that have gone through the 'rejected' activity. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query calculates the average cost (`AVG(cost)`) for all events in the `event_log` table where the `idcase` is in the list of cases returned by the subquery.
SELECT To calculate the mean cost of travel declaration processes that were rejected, you would typically need to filter the records in the `event_log` table based on a condition that identifies rejected declarations. Assuming there is a way to identify rejected declarations (for example, through a specific activity name or a status column), you can use a `WHERE` clause in your SQL query. However, since the provided schema does not include a specific column for status or rejection, I will assume that there is an activity that indicates a rejection (e.g., "Rejected"). You can adjust the activity name in the `WHERE` clause based on your actual data. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Rejected'; ``` If there is a different way to identify rejected declarations (like a specific `idcase` or a different activity name), you would need to modify the `WHERE` clause accordingly.
SELECT To calculate the average cost of travel declarations that had some phase of the process rejected, you would typically need to filter the records based on a condition that indicates a rejection. Assuming that the rejection is indicated by a specific activity name or a specific value in the `activity` column, you can use a `WHERE` clause to filter those records. Here’s an example SQL query that demonstrates how to achieve this. You would need to replace `'rejected_activity'` with the actual name of the activity that indicates a rejection: ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected_activity' OR idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected_activity' ); ``` In this query: - The outer query calculates the average cost of all events in the `event_log` table where the activity is related to a rejection. - The inner query selects all `idcase` values that have at
SELECT To answer the question about the duration of the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity in each case, you would typically need to calculate the time difference between the start and end timestamps of that specific activity. Assuming that the event log contains both the start and end timestamps for the activity, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time, MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS duration FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT idcase**: This selects the case identifier. - **MIN(timestamp) AS start_time**: This finds the earliest timestamp for the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity, which represents the start time. - **MAX(timestamp) AS end_time**: This finds the latest timestamp for the same
SELECT To determine how long the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity lasted in each case, you would typically need to find the start and end timestamps for that specific activity. Assuming that the activity has a clear start and end event in the `event_log`, you can use a query that calculates the duration by subtracting the start timestamp from the end timestamp. Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase, MIN(e1.timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(e1.timestamp) AS end_time, (MAX(e1.timestamp) - MIN(e1.timestamp)) AS duration FROM event_log e1 WHERE e1.activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY e1.idcase ORDER BY e1.idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - **MIN(e1.timestamp)**: This gets the earliest timestamp for the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity for each case,
SELECT To determine how long the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity lasted in each process instance, you would typically need to find the start and end timestamps for that activity. Assuming that the activity is logged with both a start and an end event in the `event_log` table, you can use a self-join to calculate the duration for each process instance. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase, MIN(e1.timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(e2.timestamp) AS end_time, (MAX(e2.timestamp) - MIN(e1.timestamp)) AS duration FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'declaration approved by supervisor' AND e2.activity = 'declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY e1.idcase ORDER BY e1.idcase
SELECT To report the duration of the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity for each process instance, you will need to calculate the time difference between the start and end timestamps of that specific activity for each `idcase`. Assuming that the activity can occur multiple times within a process instance, you will want to focus on the first occurrence of the activity for each case. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time, MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS duration FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **SELECT Clause**: We select the `idcase`, the minimum timestamp (start time), the maximum timestamp (end time), and the duration calculated as the difference between the end time and start time
SELECT To report the duration of the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity in each process instance, you will need to calculate the time difference between the start and end timestamps of that specific activity for each process instance. Assuming that the event log contains both the start and end timestamps for the activity, you can use a self-join to achieve this. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase, MIN(e1.timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(e2.timestamp) AS end_time, (MAX(e2.timestamp) - MIN(e1.timestamp)) AS duration FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'declaration approved by supervisor' AND e2.activity = 'declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY e1.idcase ORDER BY e1.idcase; ```
SELECT To answer the question regarding the performance of actions associated with the declaration being approved by the supervisor, you can use a SQL query that retrieves the relevant activities linked to the approval of declarations. Assuming that the activity for approval is labeled as 'Declaration approved by supervisor', you can structure your query as follows: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase, e1.activity, e1.timestamp, e1.resource FROM event_log e1 WHERE e1.activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' ORDER BY e1.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT e1.idcase, e1.activity, e1.timestamp, e1.resource**: This selects the case ID, activity, timestamp, and resource associated with the approval. - **FROM event_log e1**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **WHERE e1.activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor'**: This filters the results to only include records where the activity is 'Declaration approved by supervisor'.
SELECT To determine how long we waited for a declaration to be approved by the supervisor, we need to find the time difference between the first action taken on a declaration and the time when the declaration was approved by the supervisor. Here's how you can write the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT e.idcase, strftime('%s', a.approval_time) - strftime('%s', b.start_time) AS wait_time FROM (SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS approval_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY idcase) a INNER JOIN (SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase) b ON a.idcase = b.idcase ORDER BY e.idcase; ```

The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each resource is listed only once, even if it appears multiple times in the event log for that activity.
SELECT To find out which employees registered a saved declaration, you would typically need to filter the `event_log` table for entries where the `activity` corresponds to "saved declaration". Assuming that "saved declaration" is the specific activity name used in your database, the SQL query would look like this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'saved declaration'; ``` This query selects distinct employees (resources) from the `event_log` table who have performed the activity of registering a saved declaration. If you need additional details, such as the count of saved declarations per employee, you could modify the query as follows: ```sql SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS saved_declaration_count FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'saved declaration' GROUP BY resource; ``` This will give you a list of employees along with the number of saved declarations they registered.
SELECT To find out which employees have already saved a declaration, you would typically look for a specific activity in the `event_log` table that corresponds to the action of saving a declaration. Assuming that the activity name for saving a declaration is something like "Save Declaration", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Save Declaration'; ``` This query selects distinct employees (resources) from the `event_log` table where the activity matches "Save Declaration". Adjust the activity name in the `WHERE` clause if it differs in your actual data.

This query will retrieve the distinct activities associated with cases that ended on that specific date: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING DATE(MAX(timestamp)) = '2018-04-12' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase` values from the `event_log` table, grouping by `idcase` and filtering to only include those cases where the maximum timestamp (the last event) is on '2018-04-12'. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table where the `idcase` is in the list returned by the subquery. This ensures that only activities from cases that ended on '
SELECT To report the activities whose performance ended on the twelfth of April, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-04-12'; ``` This query selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table where the date of the `timestamp` matches April 12, 2018. The `DATE()` function is used to extract the date part from the `timestamp` for comparison.
SELECT To select activities from events that ended on '2018-04-12', you would first need to identify the cases that ended on that date. This can be done by grouping the events by `idcase` and checking the maximum timestamp for each case. Then, you can retrieve the activities associated with those cases. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING DATE(MAX(timestamp)) = '2018-04-12' ); ``` This query does the following: 1. The inner query selects `idcase` values where the maximum timestamp for that case is equal to '2018-04-12'. 2. The outer query retrieves the activities associated with those `idcase` values. Make sure to adjust the date format if your database uses a different format for dates.
SELECT To select the event activities that have '2018-04-12' as their end date, you would typically want to filter the events based on the `timestamp` field to find those that correspond to that specific date. Assuming that the end date refers to the maximum timestamp for each case, you can use a subquery to achieve this. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING DATE(MAX(timestamp)) = '2018-04-12' ); ``` In this query: - The inner query selects `idcase` values where the maximum `timestamp` for each case is equal to '2018-04-12'. - The outer query then selects the `activity` for those cases. This will give you the activities associated with cases that ended on '2018-04-12'.
SELECT To retrieve activities for which any of their performances were recorded in an event that ended on '2018-04-12', you can use the following SQL query. This query will first identify the cases that ended on the specified date and then retrieve the activities associated with those cases. ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING strftime('%Y-%m-%d', MAX(timestamp)) = '2018-04-12' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query selects `idcase` from the `event_log` table, grouping by `idcase` and using the `HAVING` clause to filter for cases where the maximum timestamp (indicating the end of the case) is equal to '2018-04-12'. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query selects distinct activities from the `
SELECT To find the activities for which performances were registered that have '2018-04-12' as their end date, you can use the following SQL query. This query will select distinct activities from the `event_log` table where the maximum timestamp for each case is equal to '2018-04-12': ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(timestamp) = '2018-04-12' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query selects `idcase` values from the `event_log` table, grouping by `idcase` and filtering to only include those cases where the maximum timestamp is '2018-04-12'. 2. The outer query then selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table where the `idcase` matches those found in the inner query. This will give you a list of activities
SELECT To find which activities have '2018-04-12' as their end date for any of their performances, you would typically need to check if there are any records in the `event_log` table that have a timestamp matching that date. However, since the schema provided does not explicitly define an "end date" for activities, we will assume that the `timestamp` field represents the date of the activity. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to find the activities that occurred on '2018-04-12': ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-04-12'; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT DISTINCT activity`: This selects unique activities from the `event_log`. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-04-12'`: This filters the results to only include records where the date part of the `
SELECT To answer the question about which activities have '2018-04-12' as their end date for any of the events related to their performances, we need to assume that there is a relationship between activities and events in the `event_log` table. However, based on the provided schema, we don't have a direct way to link activities to their end dates unless we assume that the `timestamp` of the events represents the end date of the activities. If we consider the `timestamp` of the events as the end date for the activities, we can write a query to find all distinct activities that have events occurring on '2018-04-12'. Here’s how you can do that: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-04-12'; ``` This query selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table where the date part of the `timestamp` is equal to '2018-04-12'. If
SELECT To report the name of the task associated with declaration processing actions completed on April 12, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-04-12' ) AND DATE(timestamp) = '2018-04-12'; ``` This query does the following: 1. It selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table. 2. It filters the results to include only those cases (`idcase`) that have actions completed on April 12, 2018. 3. It ensures that the activities returned are also from the same date, April 12, 2018. Make sure to adjust the date format if your SQL dialect requires a different format for date comparisons.
SELECT To list the event identifier, associated activity, and performance end date of all events associated with the 'permit final approved by supervisor' or 'declaration approved by supervisor' activities, you can use the following SQL query. Note that since the schema provided does not explicitly include a performance end date, I will assume that the `timestamp` field represents the end date of the event. If there is a different field for the end date, you should replace `timestamp` with that field name. Here’s the SQL query: ```sql SELECT id, activity, timestamp AS performance_end_date FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Permit final approved by supervisor', 'Declaration approved by supervisor') ORDER BY timestamp; ``` This query selects the `id`, `activity`, and `timestamp` (renamed as `performance_end_date`) from the `event_log` table where the activity matches either 'Permit final approved by supervisor' or 'Declaration approved by supervisor', and orders the results by the `

SELECT To list the cases in which the 'Wayne' resource was allocated, ordering the response by case identifier, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT DISTINCT idcase`: This selects unique case identifiers from the `event_log` table. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE resource = 'Wayne'`: This filters the results to only include rows where the resource is 'Wayne'. - `ORDER BY idcase`: This orders the results by the case identifier in ascending order.
SELECT To retrieve the cases associated with the 'Wayne' resource and sort them by case identifier, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` This query selects the `idcase` from the `event_log` table where the `resource` is 'Wayne' and orders the results by the `idcase` in ascending order.
SELECT To find the cases in which the 'Wayne' resource appears associated with the performance of an event, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the `idcase` from the `event_log` table where the `resource` is 'Wayne', and it sorts the results by the `idcase` identifier. ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` This query will return a list of case identifiers associated with the 'Wayne' resource, sorted in ascending order.
SELECT To report which cases have events associated with the 'Wayne' resource and order the results by the case identifier, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` This query selects distinct case identifiers (`idcase`) from the `event_log` table where the resource is 'Wayne', and it orders the results by the `idcase`.
SELECT To find the process instances that involved the work of the 'Wayne' resource and provide the answer in an ordered manner, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT DISTINCT idcase`: This selects unique process instance IDs (`idcase`) from the `event_log` table. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE resource = 'Wayne'`: This filters the results to include only those records where the resource is 'Wayne'. - `ORDER BY idcase`: This orders the results by the `idcase` in ascending order. This query will return a list of process instances that involved the work of the resource 'Wayne', sorted by their IDs.
SELECT To identify the process instances that include events handled by the resource 'Wayne', you can use the following SQL query. This query selects distinct process instance identifiers (`idcase`) from the `event_log` table where the `resource` is 'Wayne', and orders the results in ascending order: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT DISTINCT idcase`: This part of the query selects unique process instance identifiers (`idcase`) to avoid duplicates. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE resource = 'Wayne'`: This condition filters the results to include only those events that were handled by the resource named 'Wayne'. - `ORDER BY idcase`: This orders the resulting list of process instances in ascending order based on their identifiers. This query will give you a list of all process instances that have
SELECT To retrieve the identifiers of the cases in which the 'Wayne' resource acted, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` This query selects distinct case identifiers (`idcase`) from the `event_log` table where the `resource` is 'Wayne', and it orders the results by `idcase`.
SELECT To retrieve all process instances in which the 'Wayne' resource acted, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the distinct process instance identifiers (`idcase`) where the resource is 'Wayne', and orders the results for clarity: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` This query does the following: - `SELECT DISTINCT idcase`: Selects unique process instance identifiers. - `FROM event_log`: Specifies the table to query. - `WHERE resource = 'Wayne'`: Filters the results to include only those records where the resource is 'Wayne'. - `ORDER BY idcase`: Orders the results by the process instance identifier for better readability. If you want to include additional information, such as the activities or timestamps associated with 'Wayne', you can modify the query accordingly. For example: ```sql SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp FROM event_log
SELECT To find out what declarations the employee Wayne works on, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the `idcase` from the `event_log` table where the `resource` is 'Wayne', and orders the results by `idcase`: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' ORDER BY idcase; ``` This will give you an ordered list of all declarations (cases) that Wayne has worked on.
SELECT To find out what declarations Wayne works on and present them in an ordered list, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Wayne' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY idcase ASC; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT idcase**: This selects the `idcase` column, which represents the declarations. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **WHERE resource = 'Wayne'**: This filters the results to only include rows where the `resource` (the employee) is Wayne. - **GROUP BY idcase**: This groups the results by `idcase`, ensuring that each declaration is listed only once. - **ORDER BY idcase ASC**: This orders the results in ascending order based on the `idcase`. You can change `ASC` to `DESC` if you want the list in descending order. This query
SELECT To retrieve the number of cases in which each activity was performed, considering only those cases that ended on March 12, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-12' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase` values for cases that ended on March 12, 2018. It groups by `idcase` and uses `HAVING` to ensure that the maximum timestamp for each case is exactly that date. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query counts the distinct `idcase` for each `activity` that is present in the filtered list of cases
SELECT To answer the question of how many process instances each activity was performed in, considering only those process instances that ended on March 12, 2018, you would first need to identify the process instances that ended on that date. Assuming that the end of a process instance can be determined by the maximum timestamp for each `idcase`, you can use a subquery to filter the relevant process instances. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT el.idcase) AS process_instance_count, el.activity FROM event_log el WHERE el.idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(timestamp) = '2018-03-12' ) GROUP BY el.activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase` values where the maximum timestamp equals '2018-03-12'. This identifies all process instances that ended on
SELECT To provide a list that associates each activity with the number of cases they appear in for the subset of cases completed on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count**: This selects the activity and counts the distinct cases (`idcase`) associated with each activity. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02'**: This filters the records to only include those where the timestamp corresponds to March 2, 2018. - **GROUP BY activity**: This groups the results by activity, allowing the count of distinct cases to be calculated for each activity.
SELECT To provide a list that includes each activity and the number of cases in which it appears, considering only the subset of cases that were completed on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS number_of_cases FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(timestamp) <= '2018-03-02' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase` values for cases that were completed on or before March 2, 2018. It does this by grouping the records by `idcase` and using `HAVING MAX(timestamp) <= '2018-03-02'` to filter for completed cases. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query selects the `activity` and counts the distinct `
SELECT To relate the activities to the number of cases in which they appear, considering only the cases whose last event ended on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-02' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase` values for cases where the maximum timestamp (i.e., the last event) is exactly March 2, 2018. This is done by grouping the records by `idcase` and using the `HAVING` clause to filter for cases that meet the date condition. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query counts the distinct `id
SELECT To extract information about activities that occurred in cases completed on March 2, 2018, along with the number of cases in which each activity occurred, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-02' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase` values for cases that were completed on March 2, 2018. It groups by `idcase` and uses `HAVING` to filter cases where the maximum timestamp (indicating the last event) is on that date. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query selects the `activity` and counts the distinct `idcase`
SELECT To answer the question about how many declarations were processed and ended on March 2, 2018, you would need to filter the `event_log` table for entries that correspond to the specific date and then group by the `activity` to count the occurrences. Here’s how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, activity FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: - `COUNT(*) AS count`: This counts the number of occurrences of each activity. - `activity`: This is the column that specifies the type of action performed. - `WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02'`: This filters the records to only include those that occurred on March 2, 2018. - `GROUP BY activity`: This groups the results by the activity type, allowing you to see how many times each action was performed on that date. Make
SELECT To find out how many times each different processing action was performed for declarations that were both started and ended on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS action_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' GROUP BY idcase HAVING MIN(timestamp) >= '2018-03-02 00:00:00' AND MAX(timestamp) <= '2018-03-02 23:59:59' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase` values for declarations that started and ended on March 2, 2018. It groups by `idcase` and checks that the minimum timestamp (start time) is on or after the start of the day and the maximum timestamp (
SELECT To find out how many cases started with an activity whose label starts with the word 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will select distinct cases that have their first activity starting with 'permit': ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND timestamp = ( SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log AS el2 WHERE el2.idcase = event_log.idcase ) ) AS first_activities; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query selects `idcase` from the `event_log` where the `activity` starts with 'Permit%' and ensures that it is the first activity for that case by comparing the `timestamp` to the minimum timestamp for that case. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query counts the distinct `idcase` values returned by the inner query,
SELECT To report how many cases started with an activity whose label starts with 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will select distinct cases that have an activity starting with 'permit' and count them: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND id IN (SELECT MIN(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **`COUNT(DISTINCT idcase)`**: This counts the number of unique cases. 2. **`WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'`**: This filters the records to only include those where the activity starts with 'Permit'. 3. **`AND id IN (SELECT MIN(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)`**: This subquery ensures that we are only considering the first event (the one with the minimum `id`) for each case, which effectively checks if the case started with a 'permit' activity. This query
SELECT To retrieve how many cases started with activities whose names begin with 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will count distinct cases that have at least one activity starting with 'permit': ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'; ``` ### Explanation: - `COUNT(DISTINCT idcase)`: This counts the number of unique cases (`idcase`) that meet the criteria. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'`: This filters the records to include only those where the `activity` starts with 'Permit'. This query will give you the total number of distinct cases that have at least one activity starting with 'permit'.
SELECT To find the number of cases whose first event is associated with an activity whose name starts with 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will first identify the first event for each case and then filter those events based on the activity name: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS number_of_cases FROM ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS first_event_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) AS first_events JOIN event_log ON first_events.idcase = event_log.idcase AND first_events.first_event_time = event_log.timestamp WHERE event_log.activity LIKE 'Permit%' ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects the `idcase` and the minimum `timestamp` for each case, which represents the first event for that case. 2. **Join**: The outer query joins this result back to the `event_log` table to get the activity associated with the first event.
SELECT To report the number of cases in which the first event is associated with an activity whose label begins with the word 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that the first event for each case can be determined by the minimum timestamp for each case. ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE id IN ( SELECT id FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND (idcase, timestamp) IN ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner subquery `(SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)` retrieves the first event (based on the minimum timestamp) for each case. 2. The outer query checks if the activity of that first event starts with 'Permit%' and counts the distinct cases that meet this condition. 3. The `COUNT(D
SELECT To find out how many process instances have their first activity with names that begin with the word 'permit', you can use a query that groups the cases by their ID and checks the minimum timestamp for each case to identify the first activity.

Using `DISTINCT` ensures that each case is only counted once, even if there are multiple rejection events for the same case. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by pre-approver'**: This filters the records to only include those where the activity was a rejection
SELECT To answer the question about how many travel declarations each employee in the role of pre-approver has been responsible for taking the first action regarding declaration rejection, you would typically need to filter the `event_log` table for actions related to declaration rejection and ensure that you are only considering the first action taken by each pre-approver for each travel declaration. Assuming that the activity related to rejection is labeled as 'Declaration rejected' and that the role of the pre-approver can be identified through the `resource` field (or possibly another field if it exists), you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS rejection_count FROM ( SELECT resource, idcase, activity, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected' AND resource LIKE '%pre-approver%' ) AS subquery WHERE rn =

Here's how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'start trip' AND idcase NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'end trip' AND timestamp < '2018-03-31' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Outer Query**: The outer query selects distinct `idcase` values where the activity is 'start trip'. 2. **Subquery**: The subquery selects distinct `idcase` values where the activity is 'end trip' and the timestamp is before '2018-03-31'. 3. **NOT IN**: The
SELECT To find the process instances that went through the 'start trip' activity and had not finished by 31/03/2018, you would typically need to check for two conditions: 1. The process instance must have an entry for the 'start trip' activity. 2. The process instance must not have an entry for a 'finish' or equivalent activity (assuming that indicates the process has finished) before the specified date. Assuming that the 'finish' activity is represented by an activity called 'End trip' (or similar), the SQL query could look like this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' ) AND idcase NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp < '2018-03-31' ); ``` ### Explanation: - The first sub
SELECT To find the process performances that went through the 'start trip' activity and had not finished by 31/03/2018, you can use the following SQL query.

SELECT To identify the last event performed for each process instance and list the identifiers of these events in order of performance, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT id, activity, timestamp, idcase FROM event_log WHERE (idcase, timestamp) IN ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) ORDER BY timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects the maximum timestamp for each `idcase`, effectively identifying the last event for each process instance. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query retrieves the full details of these last events by matching the `idcase` and `timestamp` from the inner query. 3. **Ordering**: Finally, the results are ordered by the `timestamp` to list the events in the order they were performed. This query will give you the identifiers of the last events for each process instance, along with their activities and timestamps,
SELECT To list the last events performed for each process instance while maintaining the order in which the events were performed, you can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery to first identify the last event for each `idcase`. Then, you can join this result back to the original `event_log` table to retrieve the details of those last events. Here's how you can do it: ```sql WITH LastEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) AS last_timestamp FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) SELECT el.id, el.activity, el.timestamp, el.resource, el.cost, el.idcase FROM event_log el JOIN LastEvents le ON el.idcase = le.idcase AND el.timestamp = le.last_timestamp ORDER BY el.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (LastEvents)**: This part of
SELECT To retrieve the last intervention made in each of the travel declarations, you can use a query that groups the records by the `idcase` and selects the maximum timestamp for each case. You can then join this result back to the original `event_log` table to get the corresponding activity and other details. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT e.id, e.activity, e.timestamp, e.resource, e.cost, e.idcase FROM event_log e JOIN ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) AS last_timestamp FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) AS last_intervention ON e.idcase = last_intervention.idcase AND e.timestamp = last_intervention.last_timestamp ORDER BY e.idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects the `idcase` and the maximum `timestamp` for each case, effectively identifying the last intervention for each travel declaration. 2. **Join

SELECT To count how many actions were performed each day in processing the declarations, you can use the `DATE` function to extract the date from the `timestamp` column and then group by that date. Here’s the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS action_date, COUNT(*) AS action_count FROM event_log GROUP BY action_date ORDER BY action_date; ``` This query will give you the number of actions performed each day, with the results ordered by date. The `DATE(timestamp)` function extracts the date part from the `timestamp`, and `COUNT(*)` counts the number of actions for each date.
SELECT To list all cases in which two different resources subsequently performed the same activity, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. The idea is to join the table with itself based on the same `idcase` and `activity`, while ensuring that the resources are different and that the timestamps indicate that the activities occurred in sequence. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase, e1.activity FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase AND e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.resource <> e2.resource AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp ``` ### Explanation: - `e1` and `e2` are aliases for two instances of the `event_log` table. - The `JOIN` condition checks that both records belong to the same case (`e1.idcase = e2.idcase`)
SELECT To identify cases in which the same activity was performed twice in a row by two different resources, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. The idea is to join the table with itself, looking for consecutive rows (based on the timestamp) that have the same activity but different resources. Here's how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp AND e1.resource <> e2.resource ORDER BY e1.idcase, e1.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: - `e1` and `e2` are aliases for two instances of the `event_log` table. - The `JOIN` condition ensures that we are looking at the same case (`idcase`). - The `WHERE` clause checks that:
SELECT To find out for which declarations the same action was recorded consecutively but carried out by different employees, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. The idea is to join the table with itself, looking for consecutive records (based on the timestamp) that have the same activity but different resources (employees) for the same case (idcase). Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase, e1.activity, e1.resource AS resource1, e2.resource AS resource2, e1.timestamp AS timestamp1, e2.timestamp AS timestamp2 FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase AND e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp AND e1.resource <> e2.resource ORDER BY e1.idcase
SELECT To answer the question of how many events occurred in each case before the 'declaration final approved by director' activity was recorded, you can use a subquery to first identify the timestamp of the 'declaration final approved by director' activity for each case. Then, you can count the number of events that occurred before that timestamp for each case. Here’s how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT e.idcase, COUNT(*) AS event_count FROM event_log e WHERE e.timestamp < ( SELECT MIN(sub.timestamp) FROM event_log sub WHERE sub.activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' AND sub.idcase = e.idcase ) AND e.idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' ) GROUP BY e.idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1
SELECT To report how many events preceded the occurrence of the 'declaration final approved by director' activity for each case, you can use a subquery to count the number of events for each case that occurred before the specific activity. Here's how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT e.idcase, COUNT(*) AS events_before FROM event_log e WHERE e.timestamp < (SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' AND idcase = e.idcase) GROUP BY e.idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 0; -- Optional: Only include cases with preceding events ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The subquery `(SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' AND idcase = e.idcase)` retrieves the timestamp of the first occurrence of the 'declaration final approved
SELECT To determine how many interventions were necessary before a declaration received final approval from the director, you can use a SQL query that counts the number of interventions for each declaration up to the point of final approval. This can be achieved by filtering the events that occurred before the final approval for each declaration. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS intervention_count FROM event_log WHERE timestamp < ( SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log AS el WHERE el.idcase = event_log.idcase AND el.activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' ) GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The subquery retrieves the maximum timestamp for the final approval activity for each declaration (`idcase`). This ensures that we only consider interventions that occurred before the final approval. 2. **Main Query**: The main query counts the number of interventions (`COUNT(*)`) for each declaration (`idcase`) where
SELECT To calculate the time difference between the occurrence of the 'permit submitted by employee' activity and the 'permit approved by administration' activity, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. This will allow you to pair the two activities based on their `idcase` and then calculate the time difference using the `timestamp` field. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase, e1.timestamp AS submitted_time, e2.timestamp AS approved_time, julianday(e2.timestamp) - julianday(e1.timestamp) AS time_difference_days FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Permit submitted by employee' AND e2.activity = 'Permit approved by administration'; ``` ### Explanation: - **Self-Join**: The `event_log` table is joined with itself
SELECT To calculate the time interval between the occurrence of the 'permit submitted by employee' activity and the 'permit approved by administration' activity, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. This will allow you to match the two activities based on the same case identifier (`idcase`) and then calculate the time difference between their timestamps. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase, e1.timestamp AS permit_submitted_time, e2.timestamp AS permit_approved_time, julianday(e2.timestamp) - julianday(e1.timestamp) AS time_interval_days FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Permit submitted by employee' AND e2.activity = 'Permit approved by administration' ORDER BY e1.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: - **Self-Join
SELECT To calculate the time that passed between the employee requesting a permit and the permit being approved by administration, you can use a similar approach to the previous examples. You will need to join the event log table on itself to find the timestamps for both activities. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql WITH RequestAndApproval AS ( SELECT r.idcase, r.timestamp AS request_time, a.timestamp AS approval_time FROM event_log r INNER JOIN event_log a ON r.idcase = a.idcase WHERE r.activity = 'Permit requested' AND a.activity = 'Permit approved by administration' ) SELECT idcase, COALESCE(strftime('%s', approval_time) - strftime('%s', request_time), 0) AS duration FROM RequestAndApproval; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `RequestAndApproval
SELECT To identify cases that underwent rework, you can use a SQL query that checks for consecutive occurrences of the same activity within the same case. This can be achieved using the `LEAD` function to compare the current activity with the next one for each case. Here's how you can write the query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = next_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase`, `activity`, and the next activity (`next_activity`) for each case using the `LEAD` function. The `PARTITION BY idcase` clause ensures that the lead function operates within each case. 2. **Comparison**: The outer query filters the results to find cases where the current activity is the
SELECT To retrieve cases where rework situations occurred, you can use a SQL query that identifies cases where the same activity was performed consecutively. This can be achieved using the `LEAD` function to compare the current activity with the next activity for each case. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = next_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase`, `activity`, and the next activity (`next_activity`) for each case using the `LEAD` function. The `PARTITION BY idcase` clause ensures that the lead function operates within each case, and `ORDER BY timestamp` ensures that the activities are ordered chronologically. 2. **Main Query**
SELECT To report which cases went through rework situations, you can use a SQL query that identifies cases where the same activity was performed consecutively. This can be achieved using the `LEAD` function to compare the current activity with the next activity for each case. Here's how you can write the query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = next_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase`, `activity`, and the next activity (`next_activity`) for each case using the `LEAD` function. The `PARTITION BY idcase` clause ensures that the lead function operates within each case. 2. **Comparison**: The outer query filters the results to find cases where the current activity is the
SELECT To identify the declarations that underwent rework, we need to define what constitutes "rework." Typically, rework occurs when the same activity is performed more than once on the same declaration (idcase). Assuming that the same activity being repeated indicates rework, we can write a SQL query to find those declarations. Here’s how you can do it: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ``` In this query: - We group the results by `idcase` and `activity` to check for repetitions of the same activity on the same declaration. - The `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` clause filters the results to only include those groups where the count of activities is greater than one, indicating that rework has occurred. If you have a different definition of rework or if you want to consider other factors, please provide more details, and I can adjust the query accordingly.
SELECT To identify the declarations that had problems with rework, we need to look for cases where the same activity is repeated after a different activity has occurred. This can be done using a similar approach to the previous queries, utilizing the `LEAD` function to check for the previous activity and the current activity. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to find declarations with rework: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = previous_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **LAG Function**: The `LAG` function is used to access the previous row's activity for each case, ordered by the timestamp. 2. **Subquery**: We create a subquery that selects the `idcase`, the current `activity`, and the `previous
SELECT To find the declarations where the same intervention (activity) was performed more than once, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, activity FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT idcase, activity**: This selects the case ID and the activity (intervention). - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **GROUP BY idcase, activity**: This groups the results by both the case ID and the activity, allowing us to count occurrences of each activity for each case. - **HAVING COUNT(*) > 1**: This filters the grouped results to only include those where the count of activities is greater than one, meaning the same intervention was performed more than once for that case. This query will return a list of `idcase` and `activity` pairs where the same intervention was performed multiple times.
SELECT To find cases where activities of the same type were performed consecutively, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. The idea is to join the table with itself, comparing the current row with the previous row based on the `idcase` and the `timestamp`. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log e3 WHERE e3.idcase = e1.idcase AND e3.timestamp > e2.timestamp AND e3.timestamp < e1.timestamp ) ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Self-Join**: The table `event_log` is joined with itself (`e1` and `e2`) on
SELECT To recover cases in which activities of the same type occurred consecutively, you can use a self-join or a window function to compare the current row's activity with the previous row's activity within the same case. Here’s how you can do it using a common table expression (CTE) with the `LAG()` window function: ```sql WITH ConsecutiveActivities AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity FROM event_log ) SELECT idcase, activity FROM ConsecutiveActivities WHERE activity = previous_activity ORDER BY idcase, activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The `ConsecutiveActivities` CTE selects the `idcase`, `activity`, and the previous activity for each row using the `LAG()` function. The `
SELECT To report which cases have undergone rework situations, specifically focusing on sequences of the performance of the same activity, you can use a query that identifies cases where the same activity has been performed more than once. This can be achieved by using a window function to check for consecutive occurrences of the same activity within each case. Here's how you can write that SQL query: ```sql WITH RankedActivities AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS rn FROM event_log ), ReworkCases AS ( SELECT ra1.idcase, ra1.activity, ra1.timestamp AS first_timestamp, ra2.timestamp AS second_timestamp FROM RankedActivities ra1 JOIN RankedActivities ra2 ON ra1.idcase = ra2.idcase AND ra1.activity = ra2.activity AND ra1
SELECT To find the declarations where activities of the same type were carried out consecutively, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. The idea is to join the table with itself, matching records where the `idcase` is the same and the `activity` is the same, but the timestamps are consecutive (i.e., the timestamp of the second record is greater than the first). Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log e3 WHERE e3.idcase = e1.idcase AND e3.activity = e1.activity AND e3.timestamp > e1.timestamp AND e3.timestamp < e2.timestamp
SELECT To find the declarations that had problems with equal and consecutive interventions, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. The idea is to join the table with itself, looking for rows where the `idcase` is the same and the `activity` is the same, but the timestamps are consecutive (i.e., the second timestamp is greater than the first but less than or equal to the next timestamp). Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp AND e2.timestamp <= ( SELECT MIN(e3.timestamp) FROM event_log e3 WHERE e3.idcase = e1.idcase AND e3.timestamp > e1.timestamp ) ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Self-Join
SELECT To find the declarations where an intervention was performed at least twice consecutively, you can use a self-join or a window function to check for consecutive activities. Here’s how you can do it using a common table expression (CTE) with a window function: ```sql WITH ConsecutiveEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity FROM event_log ) SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM ConsecutiveEvents WHERE activity = previous_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (ConsecutiveEvents)**: This part of the query selects the `idcase`, `activity`, and `timestamp` from the `event_log` table. It also uses the `LAG` function to get the previous activity for each case based on the timestamp. 2. **Main Query**: The main
SELECT To identify which employees are supervisors, you would typically need to have a way to distinguish supervisors from other employees in your database. This could be done through a specific activity that indicates a supervisory role, or by having a separate table that lists employee roles. Assuming that the `event_log` table contains activities that can help identify supervisors, you might look for activities that are specific to supervisors. However, if there is no direct indication in the `event_log`, you may need to refer to another table that contains employee roles. If we assume that the `event_log` table has activities that include the term "supervisor," you could use a query like this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%supervisor%' ``` If you have a separate table for employees with their roles, for example, an `employees` table structured like this: ```sql CREATE TABLE "employees" ( "id" int, "name" TEXT COLLATE NO
SELECT To find out which employees took on the role of supervisors during the processing of declarations, you would typically need to identify the specific activities or roles that are designated as "supervisor" in your event log. Assuming that the activity names in the `event_log` table include a specific term or identifier for supervisory roles, you can use a query like the following: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%supervisor%' ``` In this query: - `DISTINCT resource` ensures that each supervisor is listed only once. - The `WHERE` clause filters the activities to include only those that contain the term "supervisor". You may need to adjust the condition based on the actual naming conventions used in your `activity` column. If you have a specific activity name for supervisors, you can replace `'%supervisor%'` with that exact name. If there are multiple activities that represent supervisory roles, you can use an `IN` clause or multiple `LIKE`
SELECT To find out which employees are responsible for the budget, you would typically look for activities in the `event_log` table that are related to budget management. Assuming there are specific activities that indicate budget responsibilities, you can filter the `event_log` based on those activities. Here’s an example SQL query that could be used to find the employees responsible for the budget: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%budget%' OR activity LIKE '%approve budget%' OR activity LIKE '%manage budget%'; ``` In this query, we are selecting distinct `resource` entries from the `event_log` where the `activity` contains keywords related to budget responsibilities. You may need to adjust the `LIKE` conditions based on the actual activities recorded in your database that pertain to budget management.
SELECT To find out which employees took on the role of budget owners during the processing of declarations, you can use a SQL query similar to the one provided for supervisors. You would look for activities that include the term "budget owner". Here’s how you can write that query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(resource) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%budget owner%' ``` This query selects distinct resources (employees) from the `event_log` table where the activity includes the phrase "budget owner". Adjust the phrase as necessary to match the exact terminology used in your database.
