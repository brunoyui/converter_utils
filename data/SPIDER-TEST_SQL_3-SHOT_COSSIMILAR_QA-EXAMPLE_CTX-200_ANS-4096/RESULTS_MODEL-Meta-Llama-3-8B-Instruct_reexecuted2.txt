SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip';
The answer to the question "How many times did the 'end trip' activity occur?" is: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip'; This SQL query will count the number of rows in the event_log table where the activity is 'End trip'.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: How many events related to the 'end trip' activity are also linked to the James resource? */ SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND resource = 'James'; This query will count the number of rows in the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'End trip' and the `resource` is 'James'.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND resource = 'James'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Peter';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Peter';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Peter' AND activity LIKE '%travel declaration%'
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-03-01' AND '2018-04-01' AND activity = 'end' This query selects the `idcase` column from the `event_log` table where the `timestamp` is between March 1st, 2018 and April 1st, 2018 (inclusive), and the `activity` is 'end'. This will return the identifiers for cases that ended in March 2018.
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', MAX(timestamp)) = '2018-03'
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_people FROM event_log;
SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(cost) > 2225
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' OR activity ='request payment';
SELECT DISTINCT idcase from event_log WHERE (activity = 'Start trip' OR activity = 'End trip') and idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase from event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' INTERSECT SELECT idcase from event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled')
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 1;

You're trying to answer a series of SQL questions based on a given database schema. Here's the answer to the last question: /* Retrieve the name of the activities and the number of times they were performed. Order the answer according to the frequency of performing the activities, from the most frequent to the least frequent. */ SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS frequency FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY frequency DESC; This query will return a list of activities and the number of times each activity was performed, ordered from most frequent to least frequent. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to count the number of times each activity appears in the `event_log` table, and the `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by activity. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results in descending order by frequency.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31';
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) = 2017 This query uses the EXTRACT function to extract the year from the timestamp column and then filters the results to only include rows where the year is 2017.
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) = 2017;
Based on the provided database schema and the question, the SQL query to answer the question would be: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp >= '2017-01-01' AND timestamp < '2018-01-01' AND idcase LIKE '%declaration%' This query selects all rows from the event_log table where the timestamp is within the year 2017, and the idcase column contains the string 'declaration'. The LIKE operator is used with the wildcard '%' to match any characters before and after the string 'declaration'.
SELECT activity, timestamp, resource, cost FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31' ORDER BY timestamp;
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE idcase LIKE 'declaration%' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2018-01-01';

SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND idcase NOT IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' )
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment') AND resource = 'Sara';
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND activity = 'Start trip' OR activity = 'End trip' AND idcase NOT IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' INTERSECT SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled' ) This query is similar to the first example provided, but with the additional condition that the resource is 'Sara'. It reports the cases where Sara was involved and for which a payment request has not yet been opened.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE idcase = 'declaration 143598' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-10' AND '2017-02-01';
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-10' AND '2017-02-01' AND idcase = 'declaration 143598' This query selects all columns (`*`) from the `event_log` table where the `timestamp` is between '2017-01-10' and '2017-02-01' (inclusive), and the `idcase` is equal to 'declaration 143598'.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'
Based on the provided SQL examples and database schema, the answer to the question "How many events was the 'Thomas' resource involved in in 2017?" would be: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2018-01-01' This query counts the number of rows in the event_log table where the resource is 'Thomas' and the timestamp is within the range of January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Report the most recent date of the performance of each activity. */ SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS most_recent_date FROM event_log GROUP BY activity This query uses the `MAX` function to find the most recent date for each activity, and the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by activity. The `AS` keyword is used to give an alias to the resulting column, which is named `most_recent_date`.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: For each activity relevant to the event log, report the date of its last occurrence. */ SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS last_occurrence FROM event_log WHERE timestamp < '2017-01-10' GROUP BY activity This query uses the `MAX` function to find the latest timestamp for each activity, effectively giving us the date of its last occurrence before 01/10/2017. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by activity, and the `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include events before 01/10/2017.
SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS most_recent_date FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT MAX(timestamp) AS last_timestamp, activity FROM event_log WHERE timestamp < '2017-01-10' GROUP BY activity

The correct SQL query to answer the question "In how many cases, performed between 5/1/2017 and 6/1/2017, is each resource associated?" is: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-01' AND '2017-06-01' GROUP BY resource This query counts the number of distinct cases (idcase) for each resource, considering only the events that occurred between 5/1/2017 and 6/1/2017. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by resource, and the COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) function counts the number of distinct idcase values for each group.
SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-01' AND '2017-06-01' GROUP BY resource
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-01' AND '2017-06-01' GROUP BY resource
The SQL query to answer the question is: SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-01' AND '2017-06-01' GROUP BY resource This query will return the number of distinct cases each resource was associated with, considering only the events that occurred between 5/1/2017 and 6/1/2017.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%intervention%' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-01' AND '2017-06-01' GROUP BY resource This query filters the event log to only include rows where the activity contains the word "intervention" and the timestamp falls between May 1st, 2017 and June 1st, 2017. It then groups the results by the resource (employee) and counts the number of distinct idcases (declarations) allocated to each resource.

Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT resource, idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY resource, idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 5 This query groups the event log by both the resource and the idcase, and then counts the number of times each resource acted on each idcase. The HAVING clause filters the results to only include those resources that acted more than five times on a declaration.
SELECT resource, idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY resource, idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 5
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) as count FROM event_log GROUP BY resource HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1)
SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1;
select resource FROM event_log where activity = 'Declaration final approved by supervisor' group by resource HAVING COUNT(*) IN (select COUNT(*) from event_log where activity = 'Declaration final approved by supervisor' group by resource order by count(*) DESC limit 10) ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
Here is the answer: SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS frequency FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by supervisor' GROUP BY resource ORDER BY frequency DESC; This query will return a list of resources that acted in carrying out the 'declaration final approved by supervisor' activity, sorted by the number of times each resource was associated with the activity in descending order (i.e., the resource that was associated with the activity the most will be at the top of the list).
SELECT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by supervisor' GROUP BY resource ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

select e1.activity, e1.resource, e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp
Here is the answer: SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' ORDER BY resource, timestamp; This query returns the case identifier and the date the 'end trip' activity was performed for each case, ordered by the resource associated with performing the activity.
select e1.activity, e1.resource, e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-02' AND '2017-05-12';
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_instances FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-02' AND '2017-05-12' This query counts the number of distinct `idcase` values (i.e., process instances) that have an `activity` of 'End trip' and a `timestamp` between May 2nd, 2017 and May 12th, 2017. The `COUNT(DISTINCT idcase)` function returns the number of unique `idcase` values, and the `AS num_instances` clause gives the result a column alias.

SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'E%';
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'E%'; This query uses the `LIKE` operator to search for activities that start with the letter 'E'. The `%` wildcard matches any characters that come after the 'E', so the query will return all activities that start with 'E', regardless of what comes after.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'E%';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'E%';

Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, I'll answer the question: "Consider only the first semester of 2018 to list which activities were carried out." The SQL query to answer this question is: SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01' This query selects the distinct activities from the event_log table where the timestamp falls within the first semester of 2018 (January 1, 2018, to July 1, 2018).
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-31'

Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: Provide a list including activity and number of cases in which it appears, considering the subset of cases completed on March 12, 2018. */ SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases FROM event_log WHERE timestamp <= '2018-03-12' AND activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY activity ORDER BY num_cases DESC; This query: 1. Filters the event log to only include rows where the timestamp is before or equal to March 12, 2018. 2. Excludes rows where the activity is 'End trip', since we're only interested in cases that were completed on March 12, 2018. 3. Groups the remaining rows by the activity column. 4. Counts the number of distinct idcase values for each activity group using the COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) function. 5. Orders the results by the number of cases in descending order (i.e., most cases first). The output will be a list of activities and the number of cases that completed on March 12, 2018, for each activity.

Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-31' ORDER BY activity; This query will return a list of activities carried out by the 'Thomas' resource between January 1, 2018 and July 31, 2018. The ORDER BY activity clause is used to sort the results by activity, so that the activities are listed in alphabetical order.
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-30';
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-30'

How many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity and which resources were responsible?** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource **3. How many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity, grouped by resource associated with its performance?** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource **4. Present, in ascending temporal order relative to the beginning of the case, the list of cases in which the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity was performed.** SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY timestamp, idcase ASC Note: The `idcase` column is a text column, so it's not possible to use it as a primary key or to order by it in ascending order. If `idcase` is supposed to be a unique identifier for each case, it should be changed to an integer or a unique identifier type.
Here are the answers to the SQL questions: **1. Report how many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity, grouped by the resource(s) associated with its performance.** SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource This query counts the number of distinct cases (idcase) for each resource that went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity. **2. Report the total number of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity associated with each resource.** SELECT count(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource This query counts the total number of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity for each resource. **3. Report the number of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity associated with each resource.** SELECT count(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource This query is identical to the previous one, and it also counts the number of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity for each resource. **4. Present, in ascending temporal order relative to the beginning of the process, the list of process instances in which the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity was performed.** SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY timestamp ASC This query selects all rows from the event_log table where the activity is 'Declaration rejected by supervisor', and orders the results by the timestamp column in ascending order (i.e., from earliest to latest). This will give you the list of process instances in which the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity was performed, in the order they occurred.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log WHERE idcase = event_log.idcase AND activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp <= '2018-03-01' ) ORDER BY idcase; This query uses a subquery to check if there is no 'End trip' activity with a timestamp before or equal to March 2018 for each 'Start trip' activity. The NOT EXISTS clause ensures that only cases that have not ended by March 2018 are returned.
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND timestamp <= '2018-03-31' AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log WHERE idcase = event_log.idcase AND activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp <= '2018-03-31' )
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND timestamp <= '2018-03-31' AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log WHERE idcase = event_log.idcase AND activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp <= '2018-03-31' ) This query selects the `idcase` values from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'Start trip', the `timestamp` is before or equal to '2018-03-31', and there is no corresponding 'End trip' activity with a `timestamp` before or equal to '2018-03-31'. This ensures that the process has not finished by 31/03/2018.
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp > '2018-03-31' )

SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100;
SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100 This query groups the activities by the `activity` column and then filters the results to only include activities that have 100 or more occurrences in the log.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: For which activities are one hundred or more occurrences recorded in the event log? */ SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100
SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) >= 100
SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp

SELECT activity, count(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity
/* Answer the following: Consider cases closed between '2018-12-01' and '2018-12-05'. What is the performance frequency for each recorded activity? */ SELECT activity, count(*) as frequency FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity This query will return the activity and the frequency of each activity in the given time period. The frequency is calculated by counting the number of rows for each activity.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS frequency FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity; This query will give you the frequency of each action in processing declarations completed between '2018-12-01' and '2018-12-05'.
