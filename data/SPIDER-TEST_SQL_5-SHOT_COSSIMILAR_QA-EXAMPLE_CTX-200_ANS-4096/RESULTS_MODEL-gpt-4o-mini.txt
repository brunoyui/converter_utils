You would then filter the results to include only those cases where the count exceeds three. Here’s how you can write that query: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` This query does the following: 1. **SELECT idcase**: This selects the `idcase` column from the `event_log` table. 2. **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. 3. **GROUP BY idcase**: This groups the results by the `idcase` column, allowing you to perform aggregate functions on each group. 4. **HAVING COUNT(*) > 3**: This filters the groups to include only those where the count of records (inter
SELECT To determine how long each case lasted, you can calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps for each case. This will give you the duration of each case. Here’s the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT idcase, strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp)) AS duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - `idcase`: This selects the case identifier. - `strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp))`: This converts the maximum timestamp of each case to seconds since the epoch. - `strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp))`: This converts the minimum timestamp of each case to seconds since the epoch. - The difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps gives the duration of each case in seconds. - `GROUP BY idcase`: This groups the results by each case, allowing the aggregation functions (MAX and MIN) to operate on each case individually.
SELECT To calculate the approximate total time for each case in the `event_log` table, you can follow a similar approach to the previous examples. You will need to calculate the duration between the first and last timestamps for each case. Here's how you can do it: ```sql WITH RankedEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) SELECT idcase, (strftime('%s', end_time) - strftime('%s', start_time)) AS total_duration FROM RankedEvents; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (Common Table Expression) `RankedEvents`:** - This CTE groups the events by `idcase` and calculates the minimum (`start_time`) and maximum (`end_time`) timestamps for each case. 2. **Final SELECT Statement:** - It
SELECT To calculate the approximate duration of each case in the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query. This query will find the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps for each case, which gives you the total duration of each case: ```sql SELECT idcase, strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp)) AS duration_seconds FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - **`SELECT idcase`**: This selects the case identifier. - **`strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp)) AS duration_seconds`**: This calculates the duration in seconds by taking the maximum timestamp (the last event) and subtracting the minimum timestamp (the first event) for each case. - **`FROM event_log`**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **`GROUP BY idcase`**
SELECT To calculate how long each case lasts, you can find the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps for each case. This will give you the duration of each case. Here's how you can write the SQL query for that: ```sql SELECT idcase, (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)) AS case_duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` In this query: - We select the `idcase` and calculate the duration by subtracting the minimum timestamp from the maximum timestamp for each case. - We group the results by `idcase` to ensure we get the duration for each individual case. Make sure that the `timestamp` column is in a format that allows for subtraction (e.g., a datetime format). If you're using SQLite, you might need to convert the timestamps to a format that can be subtracted, such as using `strftime` to convert them to seconds or another appropriate unit. Here's an example using `
SELECT To report the duration of each case in the `event_log` table, you can calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps for each case. This will give you the total duration of each case based on the events recorded. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp)) AS duration FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - `idcase`: This selects the identifier for each case. - `strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp))`: This converts the maximum timestamp of events for each case into seconds since the Unix epoch. - `strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp))`: This converts the minimum timestamp of events for each case into seconds since the Unix epoch. - The difference between the maximum and minimum timestamps gives the duration of the case in seconds. - `GROUP BY idcase`: This groups the
SELECT To calculate the duration of processing for each declaration in the `event_log` table, you can follow a similar approach to the previous examples. You will need to find the minimum timestamp (start time) and the maximum timestamp (end time) for each `idcase`, and then compute the duration by subtracting the start time from the end time. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql WITH StartEndTimes AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) SELECT idcase, strftime('%s', end_time) - strftime('%s', start_time) AS processing_duration FROM StartEndTimes; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `StartEndTimes` CTE calculates the minimum and maximum timestamps for each `id
SELECT To find the cases that had the same resource allocated for all performances of their activities, along with the resource used, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT idcase, resource**: This selects the case ID and the resource used. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **GROUP BY idcase, resource**: This groups the results by case ID and resource. - **HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1**: This condition ensures that only those cases where a single distinct resource was used for all activities are included in the results. This query will return a list of cases along with the resource that was consistently allocated for all activities within those cases.
SELECT To find the cases that had the same resource allocated to all their activities, along with the resource used, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` This query groups the records by `idcase` and `resource`, and then uses the `HAVING` clause to filter for cases where there is only one distinct resource associated with all activities in that case. The result will show the `idcase` and the corresponding `resource` that was allocated to all activities within that case.
SELECT To answer the question of which cases had the same resource allocated for all performances of their activities, along with identifying the resource, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT idcase, resource**: This selects the case ID and the resource used for that case. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **GROUP BY idcase, resource**: This groups the results by case ID and resource, allowing us to analyze the data for each case and its associated resource. - **HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1**: This condition ensures that we only include cases where there is exactly one distinct resource associated with all activities in that case, meaning that the same resource handled all activities for that case. This query will return a list
SELECT To list the cases and the resource in which all activities are handled by the same resource, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` This query groups the records by `idcase` and checks if there is only one distinct resource associated with each case. If there is only one resource for a case, it means that all activities for that case were handled by the same resource. The result will include the `idcase` and the corresponding `resource`. If you want to include the resource in the output, you can modify the query slightly to include the resource in the `SELECT` clause: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` In this modified query, `MIN(resource)` is used to select
SELECT To list the cases and resources in which all activities were allocated to the same resource, you can use a SQL query that groups by `idcase` and checks for distinct resources. Here’s how you can write that query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` This query does the following: 1. It selects the `idcase` and `resource` from the `event_log` table. 2. It groups the results by both `idcase` and `resource`. 3. It uses the `HAVING` clause to filter the groups, ensuring that only those cases where there is a single distinct resource (i.e., all activities in that case were performed by the same resource) are included in the results. This will give you a list of cases along with the resource that performed all activities for those cases.
SELECT To find the cases and the resource where all activities are handled by the same resource, you can use a SQL query that groups the data by `idcase` and checks if there is only one distinct resource for each case. Here’s how you can write that query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` However, to ensure that you get the correct resource associated with each case, you might want to use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to first identify the cases with a single resource. Here’s an example using a subquery: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` In this query: - We group by `idcase` to aggregate the data for each case. - We use `HAV
SELECT To find the cases and the resource where all activities were allocated to the same resource, you can use a query that groups by `idcase` and checks that there is only one distinct resource for each case. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` However, to ensure that you are getting the correct resource associated with each case, you might want to use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to first identify the cases with a single resource and then join back to get the resource. Here’s an example using a subquery: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` In this query: - We group by `idcase` to aggregate the data for each
SELECT To identify cases where all activities are handled by the same resource and to return both the case ID and the resource, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` However, since you want to return the resource associated with each case, you can modify the query slightly to ensure that you are selecting the resource correctly. Here’s a more precise version: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` ### Explanation: - `GROUP BY idcase`: This groups the results by each case. - `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1`: This condition ensures that only cases where all activities are performed by the same resource are selected. - `MIN(resource) AS resource`: This selects the resource
SELECT To identify cases where all activities have been allocated to the same resource, you can modify the SQL query to select both the `idcase` and the corresponding `resource`. Here's how you can do that: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT idcase, MIN(resource) AS resource**: This selects the case ID and the resource associated with that case. The `MIN(resource)` is used to get a single resource name since all resources are the same for those cases. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **GROUP BY idcase**: This groups the results by case ID, allowing us to perform aggregate functions on each group. - **HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1**: This condition filters the groups to only include those where there is
SELECT To find out which declarations were entirely handled by a single employee and to identify the name of that employee, you can use the following SQL query. This query will group the records by `idcase` and count the distinct resources (employees) involved in each case. If the count is 1, it means that only one employee handled that declaration. Here’s the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT idcase, resource FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1 ) ORDER BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query selects `idcase` from the `event_log` table, grouping by `idcase` and using `HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT resource) = 1` to filter for cases that were handled by only one employee. 2. The outer query selects the `idcase` and
SELECT To find the cases that arrived at the 'end trip' activity between the years 2016 and 2017, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT DISTINCT idcase`: This selects unique case IDs to avoid duplicates. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE activity = 'End trip'`: This filters the results to only include rows where the activity is 'End trip'. - `AND timestamp BETWEEN '2016-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'`: This further filters the results to include only those records where the timestamp falls within the specified date range (from the start of 2016 to the end of 2017).

SELECT To report data on interventions that result in a rejection of the declaration, you can use a SQL query that filters the `event_log` table for activities that indicate a rejection. Assuming that the rejection activities are identifiable by their names (e.g., containing the word "rejected"), you can select relevant columns such as `id`, `activity`, `timestamp`, `resource`, `cost`, and `idcase`. Here's an example query: ```sql SELECT id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%rejected%' ``` This query will return all records from the `event_log` table where the activity indicates a rejection, along with the associated details for each intervention. If you want to further refine the results or include additional information, you can modify the `SELECT` clause or add more conditions to the `WHERE` clause as needed.

SELECT To answer the question of how long it takes from the start of processing a declaration until the end of the trip is recorded, or until it is rejected by an employee, or until payment is made, you can use a SQL query that combines the relevant events and calculates the time differences. Below is a SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql WITH StartTimes AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ), EndTrip AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS end_trip_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ), Rejected AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS rejected_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by employee' GROUP BY idcase ), Payment AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS payment_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled
SELECT To retrieve event data associated with 'request payment' activities existing in the event log, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` column matches 'Request payment'.
SELECT To check if there are records of the 'request payment' activity in the event log and to show the associated event data, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query retrieves all columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'Request payment'. If there are any records that match this condition, they will be displayed in the result set. If no records are found, the result will be empty.
SELECT To answer the question about whether there are declarations for which a payment request has already been made, and to supply the data from these requests, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query retrieves all records from the `event_log` table where the activity is 'Request payment'. This will provide you with the details of all payment requests that have been made, including the associated `idcase`, `timestamp`, `resource`, and `cost`. If you want to ensure that you only get unique declarations (i.e., distinct `idcase` values) along with their corresponding payment request details, you can modify the query slightly: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase, timestamp, resource, cost FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This will give you a list of unique declarations that have a payment request, along with the relevant details of those requests.
SELECT To answer the question about whether there are interventions that request payment for declarations and to report the details of the performance of this intervention, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment'; ``` This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'Request payment'. This will provide you with the details of all interventions that involve requesting payment for declarations, including the timestamp, resource, cost, and idcase associated with each intervention. If you want to further refine the report, you could also consider ordering the results by timestamp or cost, depending on what specific details you are interested in. For example, to order by timestamp: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' ORDER BY timestamp; ``` Or to order by cost: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' ORDER BY cost DESC; ``` Feel free
SELECT To calculate the mean duration time of each type of activity from the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query.

Here's the SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp)) - strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp))) AS mean_duration FROM event_log GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: - `strftime('%s', MAX(timestamp))` converts the maximum timestamp of each activity to seconds since the epoch. - `strftime('%s', MIN(timestamp))` does the same for the minimum timestamp. - The difference between these two values gives the total duration for each activity. - `AVG(...)` calculates the average duration for each activity. - The `GROUP BY activity` clause groups the results by each unique activity. This query will

Assuming you have such a structure, the SQL query might look something like this: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(duration) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT activity, (julianday(end_timestamp) - julianday(start_timestamp)) * 24 * 60 AS duration FROM activity_durations -- This is a hypothetical table that contains start and end timestamps ) AS durations GROUP BY activity; ``` However, if you only have the `event
SELECT To calculate the average duration of each activity, you would typically need to have a way to determine the duration of each activity. This usually involves having a start and end timestamp for each activity. However, based on the provided schema, it seems that you only have a single timestamp for each activity in the `event_log` table. If you had a start and end timestamp for each activity, you could calculate the duration by subtracting the start time from the end time. Assuming you have a way to identify the start and end timestamps (for example, if they are in separate rows or if you have a different table that logs the start and end times), you could write a query like this: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(duration) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT activity, (end_timestamp - start_timestamp) AS duration FROM activity_durations -- This would be a hypothetical table containing start and end timestamps ) AS durations GROUP BY activity; ``` However
SELECT To report each activity's average duration, you would need to calculate the duration of each activity based on the timestamps of the events. Assuming that the `event_log` table contains multiple entries for each activity and that the duration can be calculated as the difference between the timestamps of consecutive events for the same activity, you can use a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to achieve this. However, if the `event_log` table does not have a clear way to determine the start and end timestamps for each activity, you may need to adjust the approach based on the available data. Below is a general SQL query that assumes you have a way to calculate the duration for each activity: ```sql WITH ActivityDurations AS ( SELECT activity, timestamp, LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_timestamp FROM event_log ) SELECT activity, AVG(julianday(next_timestamp) - julianday

This usually involves having a start and end timestamp for each activity. However, based on the provided schema, it seems that we only have a single timestamp for each event in the `event_log` table. If you have a way to determine the duration of each activity (for example, if you have pairs of start and end events), you would need to calculate the duration for each activity and then compute the average. Assuming you have a way to derive the duration, the SQL query might look something like this: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(duration) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT activity, (julianday(end_timestamp) - julianday(start_timestamp)) * 24 * 60 AS duration FROM event_log WHERE 
SELECT To report how long each activity lasts on average, you would typically need to calculate the duration of each activity based on its start and end timestamps. However, the provided schema only includes a single timestamp for each event, which suggests that the duration cannot be directly calculated from the data as it stands. If you had a way to identify the start and end timestamps for each activity (for example, if there were two entries for each activity: one for the start and one for the end), you could calculate the duration. Assuming you have such a structure, the SQL query might look something like this: ```sql SELECT activity, AVG(duration) AS average_duration FROM ( SELECT activity, (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)) AS duration FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, idcase ) AS durations GROUP BY activity; ``` In this query: - We first calculate the duration for each activity per case
SELECT To calculate the average duration of each type of intervention carried out during the processing of declarations, you can use the following SQL query. This query will compute the duration for each intervention type by finding the difference between the timestamps of consecutive events of the same type and then averaging those durations. Here's how you can structure the query: ```sql WITH Duration AS ( SELECT activity, strftime('%s', timestamp) AS event_time, LEAD(strftime('%s', timestamp)) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase, activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_event_time FROM event_log ) SELECT activity, AVG(next_event_time - event_time) AS average_duration FROM Duration WHERE next_event_time IS NOT NULL GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `Duration` CTE calculates the event time in seconds since the epoch for each activity and uses
SELECT To find the cases with the highest cost from the `event_log` table, you can use a query that groups the events by `idcase` and sums their costs, then selects the cases with the maximum total cost. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING total_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_cost) FROM (SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost**: This part selects the `idcase` and calculates the total cost for each case. 2. **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. 3. **GROUP BY idcase**: This groups the results by `idcase`, allowing us to calculate the total cost for each case. 4. **HAVING total_cost = (
SELECT To find the cases with the highest total cost, you can use the following SQL query. This query will group the events by `idcase`, sum the costs for each case, and then select the cases with the maximum total cost. ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING total_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_cost) FROM (SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **SUM(cost)**: This calculates the total cost for each case. 2. **GROUP BY idcase**: This groups the results by each unique case identifier. 3. **HAVING total_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_cost) ...)**: This filters the results to only include cases where the total cost is equal to the maximum total cost found across all cases. This will return the cases that have the highest total cost along with the total
SELECT To find the cases that have the maximum cost recorded in the event log, you can use a subquery to first determine the maximum cost and then filter the cases that have that cost. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log); ``` This query will return the `idcase` of all cases that have the maximum cost recorded in the `event_log` table.
SELECT To present cases whose costs are equal to the highest cost, you can use a similar approach as in the previous examples. You will need to select from the `event_log` table and filter based on the maximum cost. However, since you want to present cases, you might want to group by the `idcase` field to avoid duplicates if multiple events belong to the same case. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING total_cost = (SELECT MAX(total_cost) FROM (SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query calculates the total cost for each case by summing the costs of events grouped by `idcase`. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query selects cases where the total cost is equal to the maximum
SELECT To present cases whose costs are equal to the maximum cost already recorded in the event log, you can use a subquery to find the maximum cost and then filter the cases that have that cost. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log) GROUP BY idcase; ``` This query will return the `idcase` and the total cost for each case where the cost is equal to the maximum cost recorded in the `event_log`. The `SUM(cost)` is used to aggregate the costs for each case, and the `GROUP BY idcase` ensures that the results are grouped by each unique case.
SELECT To present the highest cost cases from the `event_log` table, you can use a similar approach as in the previous examples. You would want to select the distinct `idcase` values that have the maximum cost associated with them. Here’s how you can do that: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log); ``` If you want to retrieve all the details of the events associated with the highest cost cases, you can use a `JOIN` or a subquery. Here’s an example of how to do that: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log) ); ``` This query will return all the events that belong to the cases with the highest cost.
SELECT To find the declarations that represent the highest cost to the university, you can use the following SQL query. This query will select the `idcase` and the total cost associated with each declaration, ordering the results by total cost in descending order and limiting the output to the highest cost declaration(s). ```sql SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log WHERE cost IS NOT NULL GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY total_cost DESC LIMIT 1; -- Change LIMIT to a higher number if you want more than one declaration ``` ### Explanation: - `SUM(cost) AS total_cost`: This calculates the total cost for each `idcase`. - `WHERE cost IS NOT NULL`: This ensures that only entries with a cost are considered. - `GROUP BY idcase`: This groups the results by each unique declaration (`idcase`). - `ORDER BY total_cost DESC`: This orders the results so that the highest total cost appears first. -

This query selects all columns from the `event_log` table for the top five events with the highest costs: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT *`: This selects all columns from the `event_log` table. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `ORDER BY cost DESC`: This orders the results by the `cost` column in descending order, meaning the highest costs will appear first. - `LIMIT 5`: This limits the results to the top five rows, which correspond to the five highest-cost events. This query will give you the complete information for the five events with the highest costs.

The outer query selects all columns from the `event_log` table where the cost matches the maximum cost found in the subquery. If you want to retrieve the top 5 highest-cost events instead, you can use the `ORDER BY` clause along with `LIMIT`: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5; ``` This query orders the events by cost in descending order and limits the result to the top 5 events.

SELECT To retrieve the names of activities that were part of the 'declaration 49464' case and were not part of the 'declaration 76667' case, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase = 'declaration 49464' AND activity NOT IN ( SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase = 'declaration 76667' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The outer query selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table where the `idcase` is 'declaration 49464'. 2. The inner query selects activities associated with the 'declaration 76667' case. 3. The `NOT IN` clause ensures that only activities from the first case that are not present in the second case are returned.
SELECT To find out what occurred in declaration 49464 that did not occur in declaration 76667, you can use a query that selects the activities associated with declaration 49464 and excludes those that are associated with declaration 76667. This can be achieved using a `LEFT JOIN` or a `NOT IN` clause. Here’s an example using the `NOT IN` clause: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase = 'declaration 49464' AND activity NOT IN ( SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE idcase = 'declaration 76667' ); ``` This query does the following: 1. Selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table for `declaration 49464`. 2. Filters out any activities that are also present in the activities for `declaration 76667`. This will give you a list of activities that occurred in declaration 49464 but did not occur in declaration 766

SELECT To answer the question "How many activities were performed per resource?" you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY resource; ``` This query counts the total number of activities performed by each resource in the `event_log` table. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by the `resource` column, and the `COUNT(*)` function counts the number of rows (activities) for each resource. The result will show each resource along with the corresponding count of activities they performed.
SELECT To answer the question "How many activities were associated with each resource?" you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT resource, COUNT(activity) AS activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY resource; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT resource`: This selects the `resource` column from the `event_log` table. - `COUNT(activity) AS activity_count`: This counts the number of activities associated with each resource and labels the count as `activity_count`. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `GROUP BY resource`: This groups the results by the `resource` column, so that the count of activities is calculated for each unique resource. This query will return a list of resources along with the number of activities associated with each one.

This query will give you a list of resources along with the number of tasks associated with each one.
SELECT To determine how many actions were assigned to each employee, you would typically need a separate table or a way to identify the actions that are assigned to each employee. However, if we assume that the `event_log` table contains all actions performed by employees and that each action corresponds to an assigned task, you can count the distinct activities for each employee. Here’s a SQL query that counts the number of distinct actions (activities) performed by each employee: ```sql SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS action_count FROM event_log GROUP BY resource; ``` This query will give you the total number of unique actions (activities) that each employee (resource) has performed, which can be interpreted as the number of actions they were determined to perform. If you have a specific table or column that indicates assigned actions, you would need to adjust the query accordingly.

SELECT To determine how many cases went through the 'permit final approved by supervisor' activity before going through the 'start trip' activity, you can use a query that checks the timestamps of both activities for each case. You will need to join the event log table with itself to compare the timestamps of the two activities for the same case. Here's how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Permit final approved by supervisor' AND e2.activity = 'Start trip' AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: - `e1` and `e2` are aliases for the `event_log` table, allowing you to reference it twice in the same query. - The `JOIN` condition ensures that you are looking at events for the same case (`
SELECT To determine how many cases had the 'permit final approved by supervisor' activity occur before the 'start trip' activity, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. This will allow you to compare the timestamps of the two activities for the same case. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Permit final approved by supervisor' AND e2.activity = 'Start trip' AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: - We are selecting a count of distinct cases (`idcase`) where the 'permit final approved by supervisor' activity occurred before the 'start trip' activity. - We perform a self-join on the `event_log` table (`e1` and `e2`) to compare the activities
SELECT To determine in how many cases the 'start trip' activity eventually follows the 'permit final approved by supervisor' activity, you can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first identify the cases where the 'permit final approved by supervisor' activity occurs, and then check if the 'start trip' activity occurs later in the same case. Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql WITH ActivitySequence AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS cases_with_start_trip FROM ActivitySequence WHERE activity = 'Permit final approved by supervisor' AND next_activity = 'Start trip'; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (ActivitySequence)**: This part of the query selects the `idcase`, `activity`,
SELECT To answer the question about how many process instances have an event related to the 'permit final approved by supervisor' activity occurring before the event related to the 'start trip' activity, you can use a similar approach to the previous queries. You will need to join the `event_log` table with itself to compare the timestamps of the two activities for each process instance. Here's the SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) FROM event_log AS e1 JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Permit final approved by supervisor' AND e2.activity = 'Start trip' AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: - `COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase)`: This counts the unique process instances (idcase) that meet the criteria. - `FROM event_log AS e1 JOIN event_log AS e2`:
SELECT To determine in how many cases the 'start trip' activity occurs after the 'permit final approved by supervisor' activity, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table.

Here's how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Start trip' AND e2.activity = 'Permit final approved by supervisor' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: - `e1` and `e2` are aliases for the two instances of the `event_log` table. - We join the table on `idcase` to ensure we are looking at the
SELECT To report the number of declarations in which the start of the trip occurs after the permit with final approval from the supervisor, you can use a subquery to find the timestamps of both activities and then filter based on the conditions specified. Here's how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Start trip' AND e2.activity = 'Permit final approved by supervisor' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Self-Join**: The `event_log` table is joined with itself (`e1` and `e2`) on the `idcase` to compare activities within the same declaration. 2. **Conditions**: - `e1.activity = 'Start trip'`: This filters for the start of the trip. -
SELECT To answer the question about how many declarations have a permit with final approval from the supervisor recorded before the start of the trip record, you can use a SQL query that checks the timestamps of the relevant activities. Assuming that the activity for the start of the trip is something like 'Trip started', you can use a subquery to find the minimum timestamp for the trip start and then check if there is a corresponding permit approval before that timestamp. Here’s how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Permit final approved by supervisor' AND e2.activity = 'Trip started' AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **FROM event_log e1**: This is the first instance of the event log where we are looking for permits that have been
SELECT To answer the question of how many declarations were allowed with final approval from the supervisor before the start of the trip, you would need to identify the relevant activities that indicate a final approval from the supervisor and ensure that these approvals occurred before the trip started. Assuming that the activity indicating final approval is something like 'Final Approval' and that the trip start is indicated by an activity like 'Start trip', you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase) FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Final Approval' AND e1.timestamp < (SELECT MIN(e3.timestamp) FROM event_log AS e3 WHERE e3.idcase = e1.idcase AND e3.activity = 'Start trip'); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **COUNT(DISTINCT e1.idcase)**:
SELECT To find the events associated with the 'end trip' activity that did not occur on December 12, 2017, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp NOT LIKE '2017-12-12%' ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT * FROM event_log`: This selects all columns from the `event_log` table. - `WHERE activity = 'End trip'`: This filters the results to include only those rows where the activity is 'End trip'. - `AND timestamp NOT LIKE '2017-12-12%'`: This further filters the results to exclude any events that occurred on December 12, 2017. The `LIKE` operator is used with the wildcard `%` to match any timestamp that starts with '2017-12-12', which includes all times on that date. This query will return all events related to the 'end trip' activity that occurred
SELECT To retrieve events associated with the 'end trip' activity that occurred before or after December 12, 2017, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp < '2017-12-12' OR activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp > '2017-12-12'; ``` Alternatively, you can simplify the condition using the `!=` operator to exclude the specific date: ```sql SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp != '2017-12-12'; ``` Both queries will return all records of the 'end trip' activity that occurred either before or after December 12, 2017.
SELECT To list the events related to the performance of the 'end trip' activity that occurred before or after December 12, 2017, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT e.* FROM event_log AS e WHERE e.idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND (timestamp < '2017-12-12' OR timestamp > '2017-12-12') ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects the `idcase` of all events where the activity is 'End trip' and the timestamp is either before or after December 12, 2017. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query selects all events from the `event_log` table that are associated with the `idcase` returned by the inner query. This will give you all events related to cases that had an 'end trip' activity occurring before or after

SELECT To list the label of activities that the Virginia resource has not yet acted on, you can use a query that selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table and then excludes those activities that Virginia has already acted on. This can be achieved using a `LEFT JOIN` or a `NOT IN` clause. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia'`) retrieves all activities that the Virginia resource has acted on. 2. The outer query selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table. 3. The `WHERE activity NOT IN (...)` clause filters out the activities that Virginia has already acted on, leaving you with the activities that Virginia has not yet acted on. This will give you the
SELECT To find the activities that Virginia has not yet been associated with, you can use a query that selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table and then excludes those activities that Virginia has been associated with. This can be achieved using a `LEFT JOIN` or a `NOT IN` clause. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner query selects all distinct activities that have been associated with the resource 'Virginia'. 2. The outer query selects all distinct activities from the `event_log` table. 3. The `WHERE` clause in the outer query filters out any activities that are present in the result of the inner query, effectively giving you the activities that Virginia has not been associated with.
SELECT To find the activities for which there are no records of employee Virginia's activities in the `event_log` table, you can use a query that identifies all distinct activities and then checks which of those activities do not have any entries for Virginia. Here's how you can structure that SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia'`) retrieves all activities that Virginia has performed. 2. The outer query (`SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log`) retrieves all distinct activities from the `event_log`. 3. The `WHERE activity NOT IN (...)` clause filters out the activities that Virginia has already performed, leaving you with only those activities that have no records for her. This will give you a list of activities that Virginia has not participated in.
SELECT To retrieve the labels of activities that have not yet been associated with the employee Virginia, you can use a query that selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table where the resource is not 'Virginia'. You can also use a subquery to ensure that you only get activities that are not linked to Virginia. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner query retrieves all activities associated with the resource 'Virginia'. 2. The outer query selects distinct activities from the `event_log` table that are not in the list returned by the inner query. This way, you get a list of activities that have not been associated with Virginia.
SELECT To determine in which actions Virginia does not yet have experience, you would typically need to compare the set of all possible actions against the set of actions that Virginia has participated in. Assuming that the `activity` column in the `event_log` table contains all possible actions, you can use a query that identifies actions not associated with Virginia. Here's how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Virginia'`) retrieves all unique actions that Virginia has participated in. 2. The outer query (`SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity NOT IN (...)`) retrieves all unique actions from the `event_log` table that are not in the list of actions from the inner query, effectively giving you the actions in which Virginia does not have experience.
SELECT To calculate the average cost of cases that went through the 'rejected' activity, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%rejected%' ) AND cost IS NOT NULL; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects distinct `idcase` values from the `event_log` where the activity includes 'rejected'. This identifies all cases that have gone through the 'rejected' activity. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query calculates the average cost (`AVG(cost)`) for those cases identified in the subquery. It also ensures that only cases with a non-null cost are considered by adding `AND cost IS NOT NULL`. This will give you the average cost of all cases that have gone through the 'rejected' activity.
SELECT To calculate the average cost of cases that went through the 'rejected' activity, you can use the following SQL query. This query first identifies the cases that have the 'rejected' activity and then calculates the average cost for those cases. ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected'`) retrieves a list of unique case IDs that have the 'rejected' activity. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query calculates the average cost of all events in the `event_log` table where the `idcase` is in the list obtained from the subquery. This will give you the average cost of all events associated with cases that have experienced the 'rejected' activity.
SELECT To calculate the average cost of cases that include at least one instance of the 'rejected' activity, you can use a subquery to first identify the cases that have the 'rejected' activity, and then calculate the average cost of those cases. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT AVG(total_cost) FROM ( SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'rejected' ) GROUP BY idcase ) AS case_costs; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Subquery**: - The inner subquery selects distinct `idcase` values from the `event_log` where the `activity` is 'rejected'. This gives us a list of cases that have at least one 'rejected' activity. 2. **Outer Query**: - The outer
SELECT To report the mean cost of cases that include at least one instance of the 'rejected' activity, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT AVG(total_cost) AS mean_cost FROM ( SELECT idcase, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%rejected%' ) GROUP BY idcase ) AS case_costs; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query selects distinct `idcase` values that have at least one instance of an activity that includes 'rejected'. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query calculates the total cost for each of those cases and then computes the average (mean) of those total costs. 3. **AVG Function**: The `AVG` function is used to calculate the mean cost from the results of the inner query. This query will give you
SELECT To filter the cases that went through the 'rejected' activity and then calculate the mean of their costs, you can use a subquery to first identify the cases that have the 'rejected' activity. Then, you can calculate the average cost for those cases. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%rejected%' ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%rejected%'`) retrieves all unique case IDs (`idcase`) that have gone through the 'rejected' activity. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query calculates the average cost (`AVG(cost)`) for all events in the `event_log` table where the `idcase` is in the list of cases returned by the subquery.
SELECT To calculate the mean cost of travel declaration processes that were rejected, you would typically need to filter the records in the `event_log` table to include only those associated with rejected declarations. Assuming there is a way to identify rejected declarations (for example, through a specific activity name or a status column), you can use a `WHERE` clause to filter the relevant records. If we assume that rejected declarations are identified by an activity called 'Rejected', the SQL query would look like this: ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Rejected'; ``` If the rejection status is indicated differently (for example, through a different activity name or a specific identifier), you would need to adjust the `WHERE` clause accordingly. If there is no specific identifier in the `event_log` table for rejected declarations, you may need to refer to another table or source that provides this information.
SELECT To find the average cost of travel declarations that had some phase of the process rejected, you would typically need to filter the records in the `event_log` table to include only those declarations that have a rejection activity. Assuming that the rejection activity is identifiable by a specific value in the `activity` column (for example, "Rejected"), you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT AVG(cost) FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Rejected' ) ``` In this query: - The inner query selects all `idcase` values that have an activity labeled as "Rejected". - The outer query calculates the average cost of all events associated with those `idcase` values. Make sure to replace `'Rejected'` with the actual activity name used in your database to denote a rejection if it differs.
SELECT To calculate the duration of the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity in each case, you would typically need to find the start and end timestamps for that specific activity. Assuming that the activity has a clear start and end in the event log, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time, MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS duration FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT idcase**: This selects the case identifier. - **MIN(timestamp) AS start_time**: This finds the earliest timestamp for the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity for each case, which represents the start time. - **MAX(timestamp) AS end_time**: This finds the latest timestamp for the same activity, representing the end time. -
SELECT To answer the question about how long the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity lasted in each case, you would typically need to calculate the duration between the start and end timestamps of that specific activity. Assuming that the event log contains both the start and end timestamps for the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time, (MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp)) AS duration FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: - **MIN(timestamp)**: This retrieves the earliest timestamp for the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity for each case, which is considered the start time. - **MAX(timestamp)**: This retrieves the latest timestamp for the same activity, which is considered the end time.
SELECT To calculate how long the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity lasted in each process instance, you would typically need to find the start and end timestamps for that specific activity. Assuming that the event log contains both the start and end events for the activity, you can use a query that identifies the start and end timestamps for the activity and then calculates the duration. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT e1.idcase, MAX(e1.timestamp) - MIN(e1.timestamp) AS duration FROM event_log e1 WHERE e1.activity = 'declaration approved by supervisor' GROUP BY e1.idcase ``` ### Explanation: 1. **SELECT Clause**: We select the `idcase` to identify the process instance and calculate the duration. 2. **MAX(e1.timestamp) - MIN(e1.timestamp)**: This calculates the duration by subtracting the minimum timestamp (start time)
SELECT To report the duration of the 'declaration approved by supervisor' activity for each process instance, you need to calculate the time difference between the start and end timestamps of that specific activity for each case.

This could involve looking at the timestamps of these events and possibly the activities that occurred before or after this approval. Here’s a SQL query that could help you retrieve the relevant information: ```sql SELECT e.idcase, e.activity, e.timestamp FROM event_log e WHERE e.idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' ) ORDER BY e.timestamp ASC; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects all `idcase` values where the activity is 'Declaration approved by supervisor'. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query retrieves all activities associated with those cases, ordered by their timestamps in ascending order. 3. **Output**: This will give you a chronological list
SELECT To determine how long we waited for a declaration to be approved by the supervisor, we need to calculate the time difference between the first action taken on a declaration and the time when the declaration was approved by the supervisor. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT e.idcase, MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Declaration submitted' THEN e.timestamp END) AS submission_time, MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' THEN e.timestamp END) AS approval_time, strftime('%s', MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' THEN e.timestamp END)) - strftime('%s', MIN(CASE WHEN e.activity = 'Declaration submitted' THEN e.timestamp END)) AS wait_time_seconds FROM event_log e WHERE e.activity IN ('Declaration submitted', 'Declaration approved by supervisor') GROUP BY e.idcase HAVING approval

SELECT To retrieve the activities that had more than three records when processing travel declarations, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS activity_count**: This part selects the activity and counts the number of occurrences of each activity. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **GROUP BY activity**: This groups the results by the activity, allowing the COUNT function to count occurrences for each unique activity. - **HAVING COUNT(*) > 3**: This filters the results to include only those activities that have more than three records. This query will return a list of activities that have been recorded more than three times in the `event_log` table.
SELECT To retrieve the last activity performed along with the resource associated with its performance, you can use the following SQL query. This query will order the records by the timestamp in descending order and limit the result to the first record: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query selects the `activity` and `resource` columns from the `event_log` table, sorts the results by the `timestamp` in descending order (so the most recent activity comes first), and limits the output to just one record, which will be the last activity performed.
SELECT To report the last activity performed and the resource associated with its performance, you can use the following SQL query. This query will select the most recent activity along with the associated resource by using a subquery to find the maximum timestamp for each activity: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp = ( SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log AS el2 WHERE el2.activity = event_log.activity ) ``` This query works as follows: 1. The inner subquery (`SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log AS el2 WHERE el2.activity = event_log.activity`) retrieves the maximum timestamp for each activity. 2. The outer query selects the activity and resource from the `event_log` table where the timestamp matches the maximum timestamp found in the subquery. This will give you the last activity performed along with the resource that performed it. If there are multiple resources for the same last activity, all of them will be returned.
SELECT To retrieve the last activity performed and the resource associated with its performance, you can use the following SQL query. This query selects the activity and resource from the `event_log` table, ordering the results by the timestamp in descending order and limiting the output to the most recent entry: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query will return the last activity performed along with the resource that performed it. The `ORDER BY timestamp DESC` clause sorts the records so that the most recent timestamp appears first, and `LIMIT 1` ensures that only the top record is returned.
SELECT To retrieve the last recorded event's activity and the associated resource from the `event_log` table, you can use the following SQL query. This query will order the events by their timestamp in descending order and limit the result to the first row, which represents the most recent event: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query selects the `activity` and `resource` columns from the `event_log` table, sorts the results by the `timestamp` in descending order (so the most recent event comes first), and limits the output to just one record.
SELECT To retrieve the last recorded event and report the activity performed and the associated resource, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` This query orders the records in the `event_log` table by the `timestamp` in descending order, ensuring that the most recent event appears first. The `LIMIT 1` clause restricts the result to only the top record, which corresponds to the last recorded event.
SELECT To answer the question about the last recorded event, you can use the following SQL query. This query retrieves the activity and resource associated with the most recent event based on the timestamp: ```sql SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT activity, resource`: This part of the query specifies that we want to retrieve the `activity` and `resource` columns. - `FROM event_log`: This indicates that we are querying the `event_log` table. - `ORDER BY timestamp DESC`: This orders the results by the `timestamp` column in descending order, meaning the most recent event will be at the top. - `LIMIT 1`: This limits the result to only the first row, which corresponds to the last recorded event. This query will give you the activity performed and the resource associated with that activity for the most recent event in the `event_log`.

Then, you can join this result with the original `event_log` table to count the occurrences of each resource performing that first activity. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS first_activity_count FROM event_log WHERE (idcase, timestamp) IN ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) GROUP BY resource; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The subquery `(SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)` retrieves the earliest timestamp for each case, which corresponds to the first activity. 2. **Main Query**: The main query selects the `resource` and counts the occurrences where the `idcase` and `timestamp` match those identified
SELECT To answer the question "How many times did each resource act on the first event of a process instance?", you can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery to first identify the first event for each process instance, and then count how many times each resource acted on those first events. Here's how you can do it: ```sql WITH FirstEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS first_event_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) SELECT el.resource, COUNT(*) AS action_count FROM event_log el JOIN FirstEvents fe ON el.idcase = fe.idcase AND el.timestamp = fe.first_event_time GROUP BY el.resource; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (FirstEvents)**: This part of the query selects the `idcase` and the minimum `timestamp` for each process instance, effectively identifying the first event for each `idcase`. 2. **Main Query**: The main query
SELECT To determine the number of times each resource was the first to act on a case, you can use a subquery to find the earliest timestamp for each case and then join that result back to the `event_log` table to count how many times each resource was the first to act.

SELECT To report how many declarations each employee was involved in executing the first action, you can use a query that identifies the first action for each declaration and then counts the distinct declarations for each employee. Here's how you can structure the SQL query: ```sql SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS declarations_involved FROM event_log WHERE id IN ( SELECT MIN(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) GROUP BY resource; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query (`SELECT MIN(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase`) retrieves the minimum `id` for each `idcase`, which corresponds to the first action taken for each declaration. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query selects the `resource` (employee) and counts the distinct `idcase` values for those records that match the first action (identified by the minimum `id`). 3. **Grouping**: The results are grouped
SELECT To find out how many declaration processes were initiated by each of the employees, you would typically look for the specific activity that represents the initiation of a declaration process in the `event_log` table. Assuming that the activity name for initiating a declaration is known (let's say it's "Initiate Declaration"), you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS initiated_declarations FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Initiate Declaration' GROUP BY resource; ``` In this query: - `resource` represents the employee who initiated the declaration. - `COUNT(DISTINCT idcase)` counts the unique declaration processes initiated by each employee. - The `WHERE` clause filters the records to only include those where the activity is "Initiate Declaration". - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by each employee (resource). Make sure to replace `'Initiate Declaration'` with the actual activity name used in your `event_log`

SELECT To determine how many declarations were approved at some decision level, you can query the `event_log` table for activities that indicate approval. Assuming that the activity names related to approvals contain the word "approved", you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%approved%' ``` This query counts the distinct `idcase` values where the `activity` includes the term "approved", which should capture all declarations that have been approved at any decision level. If you have specific activity names for approvals, you can adjust the `WHERE` clause accordingly.
SELECT To answer the question "Approval actions appear in how many declarations?", you can use a SQL query that counts the distinct cases (declarations) where the activity includes an approval action. Assuming that the approval actions are represented by activities that contain the word "approved", the SQL query would look like this: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%approved%' ``` This query counts the number of unique `idcase` entries in the `event_log` table where the `activity` column contains the term "approved". Adjust the `LIKE` condition if the specific wording of the approval actions differs in your dataset.

SELECT To extract information about activities that occurred for cases completed on March 2, 2018, and the number of cases in which they occurred, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp)) = '2018-03-02' ) GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase` values for cases that were completed on March 2, 2018. It groups by `idcase` and uses `HAVING` to filter cases where the maximum timestamp (indicating the last event) is exactly March 2, 2018. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query selects the `activity` and counts the distinct `
SELECT To answer the question about how many declarations were processed and ended on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query. This query will count the number of distinct declarations (idcase) for each activity that occurred on that specific date. ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS declaration_count FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: - **SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase)**: This selects the activity and counts the distinct cases (declarations) associated with each activity. - **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - **WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02'**: This filters the records to only include those that occurred on March 2, 2018. - **GROUP BY activity**: This groups the results by the activity, allowing you to see how
SELECT To find out how many times each different processing action was performed for declarations that were both started and ended on March 2, 2018, you can use the following SQL query. This query assumes that the `event_log` table contains entries for both the start and end of each declaration process, and that you can identify the start and end of a declaration by the `idcase` and the `activity` associated with it. Here's the SQL query you can use: ```sql SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS action_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' GROUP BY idcase ) AND DATE(timestamp) = '2018-03-02' GROUP BY activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects all `idcase` values where the `timestamp` is on March 2, 2018
SELECT To find out how many cases started with an activity whose label starts with the word 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will select distinct cases that have their first activity starting with 'Permit': ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE id IN ( SELECT MIN(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) AND activity LIKE 'Permit%'; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query (`SELECT MIN(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase`) retrieves the first activity (based on the minimum `id`) for each case. 2. **Main Query**: The outer query counts the distinct `idcase` values where the first activity matches the condition of starting with 'Permit'. 3. **LIKE Clause**: The `LIKE 'Permit%'` condition filters the activities to only those that start with 'Permit'. This will give you the count of cases that started
SELECT To report how many cases started with an activity whose label starts with 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will select distinct cases that have at least one event where the activity starts with 'permit' and will count those cases. ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND id IN (SELECT MIN(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **`COUNT(DISTINCT idcase)`**: This counts the number of unique cases. 2. **`WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'`**: This filters the records to only include those where the activity starts with 'Permit'. 3. **`AND id IN (SELECT MIN(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase)`**: This subquery ensures that we are only considering the first event (the one with the minimum id) for each case, which effectively checks if the case started with a '
SELECT To retrieve how many cases started with activities whose names begin with 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query counts distinct cases that have at least one activity starting with 'permit': ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS case_count FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'; ``` ### Explanation: - `COUNT(DISTINCT idcase)`: This counts the number of unique cases (`idcase`) that meet the criteria. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'`: This filters the records to include only those where the `activity` starts with 'Permit'. This query will give you the total number of distinct cases that have at least one activity starting with 'permit'.
SELECT To find the number of cases whose first event is associated with an activity whose name starts with 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will first identify the first event for each case and then filter those events to count how many of them have an activity name starting with 'permit'. Here’s the SQL query to achieve that: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS number_of_cases FROM ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS first_event_time FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) AS first_events JOIN event_log ON first_events.idcase = event_log.idcase AND first_events.first_event_time = event_log.timestamp WHERE event_log.activity LIKE 'Permit%'; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects the `idcase` and the minimum `timestamp` (which represents the first event) for each case, grouping by `idcase`. 2. **Join**: The
SELECT To report the number of cases in which the first event is associated with an activity whose label begins with the word 'permit', you can use a subquery to find the first event for each case based on the timestamp. Then, you can filter those results to count how many of those first events have an activity that starts with 'permit'. Here’s how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND (id, timestamp) IN ( SELECT id, MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) ) AS first_events; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner subquery selects the `idcase` and `activity` from the `event_log` table where the activity starts with 'Permit%'. 2. **Finding the First Event**: It uses another subquery to find
SELECT To find out how many process instances have their first activity with names that begin with the word 'permit', you can use a query that groups the cases by their ID and checks the minimum timestamp for each case to identify the first activity. Here's how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS process_instance_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND timestamp = ( SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log AS el2 WHERE el2.idcase = event_log.idcase ) ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query selects the `idcase` where the activity starts with 'Permit%' and matches the minimum timestamp for that case. This identifies the first activity for each case. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query counts the distinct `idcase` from the event log that
SELECT To find the number of process instances (or cases) that started with an activity whose name starts with the word 'permit', you can use the following SQL query. This query will select distinct cases that have an activity starting with 'Permit' and ensure that the activity is the first one in the sequence for each case. Assuming that the `timestamp` column indicates the order of activities (with earlier timestamps representing earlier activities), you can use a subquery to filter for the first activity of each case: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS number_of_process_instances FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND timestamp = ( SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log AS el2 WHERE el2.idcase = event_log.idcase ) ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner subquery selects the `idcase` where the activity starts with '
SELECT To retrieve the number of times processing of a travel declaration started with an activity associated with a permit, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND idcase IN (SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip'); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **COUNT(*)**: This counts the total number of records that meet the specified conditions. 2. **FROM event_log**: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. 3. **WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'**: This condition filters the records to include only those activities that start with "Permit". 4. **AND idcase IN (SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip')**: This subquery ensures that we only count permits that are associated with cases where the trip has started. This query will give you the total number of times a travel declaration started with a permit-related activity.
SELECT To find out how many travel declarations have a permit action associated with the start of their processing, you would typically look for cases where the first action recorded for each declaration is a permit action. Assuming that the earliest action for each `idcase` can be determined by the `timestamp`, you can use the following SQL query: ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' AND timestamp = ( SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log AS el WHERE el.idcase = event_log.idcase ) ); ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner subquery selects the `idcase` where the activity is a permit and the timestamp is the minimum timestamp for that `idcase`. 2. The outer query counts the distinct `idcase` that meet the criteria of having a permit action as the first action. This query

This can be achieved using a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to filter the events before the 'end trip' activity. Here’s an example SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql WITH end_trip_events AS ( SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' ) SELECT e.idcase, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log e JOIN end_trip_events et ON e.idcase = et.idcase AND e.timestamp < et.timestamp GROUP BY e.idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Common Table Expression (CTE)**: The `end_trip_events` CTE selects all instances of the 'End trip'
SELECT To answer the question of how many activity occurrences were recorded in each process instance until it went through the 'end trip' activity, you can use a query that counts the number of activities for each process instance (idcase) that occurred before the 'end trip' activity. This can be achieved by using a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to filter the events that occurred before the 'end trip' activity for each process instance. Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log WHERE timestamp < ( SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log AS sub WHERE sub.activity = 'End trip' AND sub.idcase = event_log.idcase ) GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The subquery selects the minimum timestamp of the 'end trip' activity for each process instance (idcase). This ensures that we only consider activities
SELECT To answer the question of how many events occurred in each process instance until it went through the 'end trip' activity, you can use a query that counts the events for each `idcase` where the 'end trip' activity has occurred. You can achieve this by using a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to filter the cases that have the 'end trip' activity and then count the events for those cases. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS event_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' ) GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. The inner query (`SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip'`) retrieves all unique process instances (cases) that have gone through the 'end trip' activity. 2. The outer query counts the number of events
SELECT To check the number of events that occurred in each case until it reached the performance of the 'end trip' activity, you can use a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to first filter the events for each case and then count them up to the 'end trip' activity. Here's how you can do it: ### Using a Subquery ```sql SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS event_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' ) AND timestamp < ( SELECT MIN(timestamp) FROM event_log AS el2 WHERE el2.idcase = event_log.idcase AND el2.activity = 'End trip' ) GROUP BY idcase; ``` ### Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) ```sql WITH EndTripEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS end_trip_time FROM event_log WHERE activity =
SELECT To check the number of events that occurred in each process instance until it reached the performance of the 'end trip' activity, you can use a subquery to count the events for each `idcase` that occurred before the 'end trip' activity.

This ensures that we only count events that occurred before the 'end trip' activity. 2. **Main Query**: The main query counts all events for each `idcase` where the timestamp is less than the timestamp of the 'end trip' activity
SELECT To check how many actions were performed until the end of the trip took place in each travel declaration case, you can use a query that counts the number of actions for each `idcase` up to the timestamp of the 'End trip' activity. This can be achieved by joining the `event_log` table with itself to filter the actions that occurred before the 'End trip' activity for each case. Here's how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT e.idcase, COUNT(e.id) AS action_count FROM event_log e JOIN ( SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS end_trip_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ) end_trip ON e.idcase = end_trip.idcase AND e.timestamp < end_trip.end_trip_time GROUP BY e.idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery (`end_trip`)**: This subquery selects each `idcase` and the
SELECT To determine how many actions were necessary for each travel declaration until the end of the trip was recorded, you can use a query that counts the number of actions for each `idcase` up to the point where the activity 'End trip' is recorded. You can achieve this by using a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) to filter the events for each declaration. Here’s a SQL query that accomplishes this: ```sql SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS action_count FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' ) GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'End trip' THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL ORDER BY idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects distinct `idcase` values where the activity is 'End trip'. This ensures that we are only considering declarations that have an

This can be achieved using the `LEAD` function to compare the current activity with the next activity for each case. Here’s how you can write the SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = next_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: The inner query selects `idcase`, `activity`, and the next activity (`next_activity`) for each case using the `LEAD` function. The `PARTITION BY idcase` clause ensures that the lead function operates within each case, and `ORDER BY timestamp` ensures that activities are ordered chronologically. 2. **Main Query**
SELECT To report which cases went through rework situations, we can identify cases where the same activity was performed more than once. This can be achieved by using a common table expression (CTE) or a subquery to count the occurrences of each activity for each case and then filter for those with a count greater than one. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to achieve this: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity ) AS activity_counts WHERE activity_count > 1; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Inner Query**: The inner query groups the records by `idcase` and `activity`, counting how many times each activity was performed for each case. 2. **Outer Query**: The outer query filters the results to only include cases where the count of a specific activity is greater than one, indicating that the activity was performed multiple times
SELECT To identify the declarations that underwent rework, we need to look for cases where the same activity was performed more than once on the same declaration (idcase). This can be done by grouping the records by `idcase` and `activity`, and then counting the occurrences. If the count is greater than one, it indicates that there was rework. Here’s the SQL query to find the declarations with rework: ```sql SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ``` This query groups the records by both `idcase` and `activity`, and the `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` clause filters the results to only include those groups where the same activity was performed more than once for a given declaration.
SELECT To identify the declarations that experienced problems with rework, we need to look for cases where the same activity was performed more than once in the sequence of events for a given declaration. This can be achieved by using a similar approach to the previous queries, specifically by utilizing the `LEAD` function to check for consecutive activities and then filtering for cases where the same activity appears more than once. Here’s how you can write the SQL query to find declarations with rework: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = previous_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Subquery**: We create a subquery that selects `idcase`, `activity`, and the previous activity using the `LAG` function. The `LAG` function allows us to access the previous row's
SELECT To find the declarations where the same intervention (activity) was performed more than once, you can use the following SQL query. This query groups the records by `idcase` and `activity`, and then counts the occurrences of each activity for each case. It filters the results to include only those cases where the count is greater than one. Here’s the SQL query: ```sql SELECT idcase, activity FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase, activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; ``` ### Explanation: - `SELECT idcase, activity`: This selects the case ID and the activity. - `FROM event_log`: This specifies the table from which to retrieve the data. - `GROUP BY idcase, activity`: This groups the results by both the case ID and the activity, allowing us to count occurrences of each activity within each case. - `HAVING COUNT(*) > 1`: This filters the grouped results to include only those where the count of activities is
SELECT To find cases where activities of the same type were performed consecutively, you can use a self-join or a window function to compare the current row's activity with the previous row's activity. Here's an example using a common table expression (CTE) with the `LAG()` window function: ```sql WITH RankedEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity FROM event_log ) SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM RankedEvents WHERE activity = previous_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The `RankedEvents` CTE selects the `idcase`, `activity`, and `timestamp` from the `event_log` table. It also uses the `LAG()` function to get the previous activity for each case based on the order of the timestamp.
SELECT To recover cases in which activities of the same type occurred consecutively, you can use a self-join or a window function to compare the current activity with the previous one within the same case. Here’s how you can do it using a common table expression (CTE) with the `LAG()` window function: ```sql WITH ConsecutiveActivities AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity FROM event_log ) SELECT DISTINCT idcase, activity FROM ConsecutiveActivities WHERE activity = previous_activity; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (ConsecutiveActivities)**: This part of the query selects the `idcase`, `activity`, and the previous activity for each row using the `LAG()` function. The `PARTITION BY idcase` clause ensures that the comparison is made within the
SELECT To report which cases have undergone rework situations, specifically focusing on sequences of performance of the same activity, you can use a query that identifies cases where the same activity was performed consecutively. This can be achieved by using a self-join or a window function to check for consecutive activities. Here's an example of how you might write such a query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log e3 WHERE e3.idcase = e1.idcase AND e3.timestamp > e1.timestamp AND e3.timestamp < e2.timestamp ) ORDER BY e1.idcase; ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Self-Join**: The table `event_log` is joined
SELECT To find the declarations where activities of the same type were carried out consecutively, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. The idea is to join the table with itself, matching records where the `idcase` is the same and the `activity` is the same, but the timestamps are consecutive. Here's how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp AND e1.timestamp = ( SELECT MAX(e3.timestamp) FROM event_log e3 WHERE e3.idcase = e1.idcase AND e3.activity = e1.activity AND e3.timestamp < e2.timestamp ) ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Self-Join**: The table `event_log` is joined
SELECT To find the declarations that had problems with equal and consecutive interventions, you can use a self-join on the `event_log` table. The idea is to join the table with itself, looking for rows where the `idcase` is the same and the `activity` is the same, but the timestamps are consecutive (i.e., the second intervention occurs immediately after the first one). Here's how you can write that SQL query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log e1 JOIN event_log e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = e2.activity AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp AND e1.timestamp = (SELECT MIN(e3.timestamp) FROM event_log e3 WHERE e3.idcase = e1.idcase AND e3.activity = e1.activity AND e3.timestamp > e1.timestamp); ``` ### Explanation: 1. **Self-Join
SELECT To find the declarations where an intervention was performed at least twice consecutively, you can use a self-join or a window function to check for consecutive activities. Here’s an example using a common table expression (CTE) with a window function: ```sql WITH RankedEvents AS ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS previous_activity FROM event_log ) SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM RankedEvents WHERE activity = previous_activity ``` ### Explanation: 1. **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: The `RankedEvents` CTE selects the `idcase`, `activity`, and `timestamp` from the `event_log` table. It also uses the `LAG()` function to get the previous activity for each case, ordered by the timestamp. 2. **Main Query**: The main query selects
SELECT To identify which employees are supervisors, you would typically look for a specific activity or role designation in the `event_log` table that indicates an employee's supervisory status. However, since the provided schema does not include a direct way to identify supervisors, we can infer this from the activities logged in the `event_log` table. Assuming that the activities related to supervisors include terms like "supervisor" in the activity description, you can use the following SQL query to retrieve a list of employees who have performed activities that indicate they are supervisors: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%supervisor%' ``` This query selects distinct resources (employees) from the `event_log` table where the activity includes the term "supervisor". Adjust the `LIKE` clause as necessary based on the actual activity descriptions in your dataset. If there are specific activities that are known to be performed only by supervisors, you can replace the `LIKE` condition with those specific activities.
SELECT To find out which employees took on the role of supervisors during the processing of declarations, you can use a SQL query that selects distinct resources (employees) from the `event_log` table where the activity indicates that they performed a supervisory role. Assuming that the activity names related to supervisors contain the term "supervisor", the query would look like this: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(resource) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%supervisor%' ``` This query will return a list of unique employees who have been involved in activities that include the term "supervisor" in their description. Adjust the `LIKE` clause as necessary to match the specific terminology used in your database for supervisory roles.
SELECT To find out which employees are responsible for the budget, you would typically look for activities in the `event_log` table that are related to budget management. Assuming that the activities related to budget management contain the word "budget" in their description, you can use a query similar to the following: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(resource) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%budget%' ``` This query selects distinct resources (employees) from the `event_log` table where the activity includes the term "budget". Adjust the `LIKE` clause as necessary to match the specific wording used in your database for budget-related activities.
SELECT To find out which employees took on the role of budget owners during the processing of declarations, you can use a SQL query similar to the one you provided for supervisors. You would look for activities that include the term "budget owner". Here’s how you can write that query: ```sql SELECT DISTINCT(resource) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%budget owner%' ``` This query selects distinct resources (employees) from the `event_log` table where the activity includes the phrase "budget owner". Adjust the phrase as necessary to match the exact terminology used in your database.
