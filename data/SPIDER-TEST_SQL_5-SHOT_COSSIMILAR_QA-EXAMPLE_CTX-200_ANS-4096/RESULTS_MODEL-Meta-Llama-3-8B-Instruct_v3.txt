Based on the provided SQL examples, the answer to the question "How many times was the 'end trip' activity performed?" is: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip'; This query will count the number of rows in the event_log table where the activity is 'End trip'.
A SQL challenge! Let's break down each question and provide the answers: 1. In how many cases did the 'end trip' activity occur considering the time interval of 05/02/2017 and 05/12/2017? Answer: `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-02' and '2017-05-12'` This query counts the number of distinct `idcase` values where the `activity` is 'End trip' and the `timestamp` falls within the specified date range. 2. How many activity occurrences were recorded in each case until the 'end trip' activity was performed? Answer: `select count(*), e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp group by e1.idcase` This query joins the `event_log` table with itself, linking each row to the corresponding 'End trip' event. It then counts the number of rows for each `idcase` value before the 'End trip' event. 3. How many occurrences of activities were recorded in each case until the 'end trip' activity occurred? Answer: Same as question 2. 4. How many instances of activity were recorded in each case until it went through the 'end trip' activity? Answer: Same as question 2. 5. How many events occurred in each case before it went through the 'end trip' activity? Answer: Same as question 2. 6. How many occurrences of the 'end trip' activity are there in the event log? Answer: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip'` This query simply counts the number of rows where the `activity` is 'End trip'. Note that questions 2-5 are asking for the same information, just phrased differently. The correct answer is the same for all of them.

SELECT idcase, MAX(cost) AS max_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY max_cost DESC
SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log) This query will return all rows from the event_log table where the cost is equal to the maximum cost in the table.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)

SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)
SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5;
Here are the answers to the SQL questions: 1. Select the five events with the highest costs. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost IN (SELECT DISTINCT cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5) 2. Select the five events with the highest costs. List all attributes of these events. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost IN (SELECT DISTINCT cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5) 3. List the values of the attributes of the five highest-cost events. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost IN (SELECT DISTINCT cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5) 4. Select the five highest-cost events. List all attributes of these events. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost IN (SELECT DISTINCT cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5) 5. List the events that have a non-zero cost. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost IS NOT NULL 6. Present the events whose cost amounts are equal to the maximum cost. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log) Note: The above SQL queries assume that the "cost" column in the "event_log" table contains numeric values. If the "cost" column contains non-numeric values, the queries may need to be modified accordingly.
SELECT * FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Report the events whose costs are equal to the maximum cost. */ SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log) This query uses a subquery to find the maximum cost in the event_log table, and then selects all rows from the same table where the cost column is equal to that maximum cost.
Based on the provided database schema and the problem statement, the answer would be: /* Report the highest cost events. */ SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log) This SQL query will return all the events that have the highest cost in the event log.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE cost = (SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log)

Here is the answer: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip';
Here is the answer: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip'; This query will return all the events in the event_log table where the activity is 'Start trip', along with their attributes (id, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase).
select count(*), activity from event_log where activity = 'Start trip' or activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY activity
select DISTINCT idcase FROM (select idcase, timestamp, activity FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING strftime('%Y-%m', MIN(timestamp)) = '2017-03') where activity = 'Start trip'
Here is the answer: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip'; This query will return all columns (id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase) for all events in the event_log table where the activity is 'Start trip'.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip'; This query will return all columns (*) from the event_log table where the activity column is equal to 'Start trip'.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip';
Here is the answer to the last question: /* Answer the following: Present the events, with their attributes, that refer to the'start trip' activity. */ SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip'; This SQL query will return all the events from the "event_log" table where the "activity" is 'Start trip'. The "*" symbol is a wildcard that means "all columns" so the query will return all the columns (id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase) for the events where the activity is 'Start trip'.

Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: List the cost of each event and associated activity, ordered by the cost of the event. */ SELECT activity, cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost ASC
It looks like you're trying to answer some SQL questions based on a given database schema. Here's the answer to the last question: /* Answer the following: List the cost of each event and the activity performed, ordered by the cost of the event. */ SELECT activity, cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost; This query will return a list of all events, along with the activity performed, and the cost of each event, sorted in ascending order by the cost. If you want to sort in descending order, you can use the DESC keyword: SELECT activity, cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC;
SELECT cost, activity FROM event_log ORDER BY cost;
SELECT activity, cost, id FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC;
SELECT id, activity, resource, cost FROM event_log ORDER BY cost DESC;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'; This query will return all rows from the event_log table where the activity column starts with the string 'Permit'.
Here is the answer: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%'; This query will return all rows from the event_log table where the activity column starts with the string 'Permit'.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' This query will retrieve all events, and their attributes, that are associated with the 'permit' activity. The LIKE operator is used with the wildcard character % to match any characters after the string 'Permit'.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%';
Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, the answer to the question is: The performances of the 'permit' activity are associated with the events that have an activity name starting with 'Permit'. These events are characterized by having an activity name that contains the word 'Permit'. Here is the SQL query that answers this question: SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' This query will return a list of unique activity names that start with 'Permit', which are the events associated with the 'permit' activity.
Based on the provided SQL examples and database schema, I'll answer the question: "What characterizes the events associated with the performance of the 'permit' activity?" The SQL query to answer this question is: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' This query will return all columns (*) from the event_log table where the activity column contains the string 'Permit' followed by any characters (% is a wildcard character in SQL). This will give us the characteristics of the events associated with the performance of the 'permit' activity, such as the timestamp, resource, cost, and idcase for each event.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Permit'
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%';
SELECT DISTINCT activity, idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%permit%' AND activity LIKE '%declaration%'
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%permit%' AND idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 )
SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log
SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log
SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log;
SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log;
SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log
Based on the provided SQL examples, the answer to the question "What was the amount spent on the most expensive intervention already recorded during the processing of declarations?" is: SELECT MAX(cost) FROM event_log This query will return the maximum cost of any intervention recorded in the event_log table, which corresponds to the most expensive intervention already recorded during the processing of declarations.
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND resource = 'Thomas'
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND resource = 'Thomas'
Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, the answer to the question is: SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND resource = 'Thomas' This query will return the identifiers of the cases in which both 'Sara' and 'Thomas' resources acted.
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' )
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND resource = 'Thomas'
SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' )
SELECT COUNT(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by administration' GROUP BY resource
SELECT COUNT(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by administration' GROUP BY resource
SELECT COUNT(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by administration' GROUP BY resource
SELECT COUNT(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'declaration rejected by administration' GROUP BY resource
SELECT COUNT(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by administration' GROUP BY resource

Based on the provided database schema, it seems that there is no column named "people" or any other column that would indicate the person who worked on a case. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the question "Which people worked on more than three cases?" with the given information. However, if we assume that the "idcase" column represents the case identifier and the "activity" column represents the activity performed on the case, we can answer the question "Which cases have more than three different activities performed?" as follows: SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT activity) > 3 This query groups the event log by case identifier and counts the number of distinct activities performed on each case. The HAVING clause filters the results to only include cases where more than three different activities were performed.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log GROUP BY resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) > 3; This query groups the employees (resource) by their count of distinct cases (idcase) and filters the results to only include employees who worked on more than three cases. The DISTINCT keyword is used to ensure that each employee is only counted once, even if they worked on multiple cases.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'permit final approved by director';
Here is the answer: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'permit final approved by a director';
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Permit final approved by director'; This query counts the number of times the processing of declarations required a final permit to be granted by a director.
Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, I'll answer the question: /* Answer the following: How many times has a final permit been approved by a director? */ To answer this question, we need to find the number of times the 'Permit approved by director' activity has been performed. Since the activity name is not provided in the SQL examples, we can assume it's not present in the event_log table. Therefore, we can't provide an exact answer. However, if the activity name is 'Permit approved by director', we can use the following SQL query to find the count: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Permit approved by director' If the activity name is not present in the event_log table, the query will return 0.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT DISTINCT strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp) AS date FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT DISTINCT strftime('%Y-%m-%d', timestamp) AS date FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND resource LIKE '%s';
SELECT SUM(cost), activity, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, resource
SELECT SUM(cost) AS total_cost, activity, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, resource
/* Answer the following: What is the total sum of event costs considering each activity-resource pair? */ SELECT SUM(cost) FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, resource
SELECT activity, resource, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, resource
/* Answer the following: For each activity and resource pair, what is the total sum of costs of the events in which each pair was recorded? */ SELECT activity, resource, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, resource ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT SUM(cost), activity, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, resource This query groups the events by both the activity and resource columns, and then calculates the total cost of events for each activity-resource pair using the SUM aggregation function.
SELECT SUM(cost), activity, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, resource
SELECT resource, activity, SUM(cost) AS total_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY resource, activity ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
select count(*), e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp group by e1.idcase
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN activity ='start trip' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS start_trip_count, COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = 'end trip' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS end_trip_count FROM event_log; This query uses a technique called "conditional aggregation" to count the number of occurrences of'start trip' and 'end trip' activities. The CASE statement checks if the activity column matches the desired value, and if so, returns a value of 1. If not, it returns NULL. The COUNT function then counts the number of non-NULL values for each case.
select count(*), e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp group by e1.idcase
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_events, SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'Start trip' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as start_trip_events, SUM(CASE WHEN activity = 'End trip' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as end_trip_events FROM event_log
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Start trip', 'End trip') GROUP BY activity; This query will return the number of times each of the 'Start trip' and 'End trip' activities was recorded.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('start trip', 'end trip')
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity; This query will return two rows, one for the'start trip' activity and one for the 'end trip' activity, with the count of occurrences for each activity.
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) AS count FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('start trip', 'end trip') GROUP BY activity
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Begin trip', 'End trip')
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Start trip', 'End trip')
SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(activity) > 3;
SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3; This query will return the activities that have more than three events recorded in the event_log table.
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
SELECT activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT MAX(timestamp), activity, resource FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, resource ORDER BY timestamp DESC
SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, the answer to the last question is: /* Answer the following: Considering the last recorded event, what activity was performed and what resource was associated with its performance? */ SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; This SQL query will return the activity and resource associated with the most recent event in the event_log table. The ORDER BY timestamp DESC clause sorts the events in descending order by timestamp, and the LIMIT 1 clause returns only the most recent event.
SELECT activity, resource FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT resource, activity FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
Here is the answer to the last question: /* Answer the following: Who was the employee who performed the last activity ever recorded in the travel declaration process and what was that activity? */ SELECT resource, activity FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; This query uses the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the rows in the `event_log` table by the `timestamp` column in descending order (newest first). The `LIMIT 1` clause then returns only the first row, which is the most recent activity ever recorded in the travel declaration process. The `SELECT` clause returns the `resource` and `activity` columns for this row, which identifies the employee who performed the last activity and what that activity was.

Here is the answer: /* Answer the following: Which case was the last to perform a 'declaration final approved by director' activity? */ SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; This query uses the ORDER BY clause to sort the results by the timestamp column in descending order (newest first), and then uses the LIMIT 1 clause to return only the top row, which corresponds to the last case to perform the 'declaration final approved by director' activity.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: What was the last process instance to perform the 'declaration final approved by director' activity? */ SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; This query selects the `idcase` and `timestamp` columns from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'Declaration final approved by director', orders the results by `timestamp` in descending order (newest first), and limits the result to the top 1 row, which is the last process instance to perform the 'declaration final approved by director' activity.
SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: Report the identifier of the case that was the last to perform the 'declaration final approved by director' activity. */ SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; This query works by: 1. Filtering the event log to only include rows where the activity is 'Declaration final approved by director'. 2. Ordering the results by timestamp in descending order (newest first). 3. Limiting the results to the top 1 row, which is the most recent (and therefore the last) occurrence of the activity.

SELECT count(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%approved%'
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%approved%'; This query will count the number of distinct cases that have gone through the activity that contains the word 'approved' in its name.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%approved%'
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%approved%'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%approved%'
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%approved%' This query uses the LIKE operator to search for activities that contain the word 'approved' (case-insensitive due to the COLLATE NOCASE specification in the table schema). The COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) function then counts the number of unique idcase values that correspond to these activities.

SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase), activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
The correct answer is: SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log GROUP BY activity; This SQL query will return the number of cases in which each activity was performed. The COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) function counts the number of unique idcase values for each activity, effectively giving the number of cases in which each activity was performed.
Based on the provided SQL examples, I will answer the question: "Various actions, activities or tasks are possible when processing a declaration. It is useful to know the number of declarations associated with the performance of each of these actions, activities or tasks." The SQL query to answer this question is: SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as declaration_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity This query will return a list of activities, along with the number of declarations associated with each activity. The result will be ordered by the activity name.
SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase), activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'R%' AND timestamp > ( SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'D%' );
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'R%' AND timestamp > ( SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'D%' )
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'R%' AND timestamp > ( SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'D%' )

Here's the answer: /* Answer the following: How many cases started with an activity whose label starts with the word 'permit'? */ SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' This query uses the COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) function to count the number of unique idcase values where the activity column starts with the word 'permit'. The LIKE operator is used with the pattern 'Permit%' to match any activity name that starts with 'permit'.
Here are the answers: 1. For each case, report the number of times a 'permit' activity was performed. SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' GROUP by idcase This query will return the count of 'permit' activities for each case. 2. List the cases in which there is more than one event record associated with an activity whose name starts with 'permit'. select idcase from event_log where activity like 'Permit%' GROUP BY idcase HAVING count(*) > 1 This query will return the cases that have more than one 'permit' activity. 3. How many 'permit' activities were performed for each case? SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' GROUP by idcase This query will return the count of 'permit' activities for each case. 4. How many instances of 'permit' activities are there in each of the cases? SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' GROUP by idcase This query will return the count of 'permit' activities for each case. 5. How many times were 'permit' activities performed in each case? SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' GROUP by idcase This query will return the count of 'permit' activities for each case. 6. There is a subset of activities whose label starts with 'permit'. Report how many cases started with one of these activities. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' This query will return the number of unique cases that have at least one 'permit' activity.

It seems like you're trying to solve some SQL queries based on an event log. Here's the answer to the last query: /* Answer the following: How many instances of activity were recorded in each case until it went through the 'end trip' activity? */ SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_activities FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase This query will give you the count of activities for each case until it reaches the 'end trip' activity. Note that this assumes that the 'end trip' activity marks the end of a case. If there are other activities after 'end trip', you might need to adjust the query accordingly.
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_events FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log WHERE activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND idcase = event_log.idcase)
SELECT el1.idcase, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log el1 JOIN event_log el2 ON el1.idcase = el2.idcase AND el1.timestamp < el2.timestamp AND el2.activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY el1.idcase
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_events FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' ) AND timestamp <= ( SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' ) GROUP BY idcase
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) as num_events FROM event_log WHERE activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY num_events DESC;
It seems like you're trying to answer a series of questions based on a given database schema. The schema defines a table called "event_log" which contains information about events that occurred in a process. Each event is associated with an activity, a timestamp, a resource, a cost, and a process instance. Here's the answer to the last question: /* Answer the following: Check the number of events that occurred in each process instance until it reached the performance of the 'end trip' activity. */ SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_events FROM event_log WHERE activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY num_events DESC; This query will return a list of process instances (identified by the "idcase" column) along with the number of events that occurred in each process instance until it reached the 'end trip' activity. The "ORDER BY" clause is used to sort the results in descending order based on the number of events.
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_actions FROM event_log WHERE activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase
SELECT e1.idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_actions FROM event_log e1 WHERE e1.activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY e1.idcase
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01'
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01'
SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-30'
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01'
Here's the answer: SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-31'
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-31' This query will return a list of activities performed by the 'Thomas' resource between January 1, 2018 and July 31, 2018.
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-30';
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01'
Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, the answer to the question "What types of actions did the employee Thomas work on in the first semester of 2018?" is: SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01' This SQL query will return a list of unique activities performed by the employee Thomas in the first semester of 2018 (January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2018).
SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY idcase, timestamp
SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY idcase, timestamp
SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY start_time;

A SQL challenge! Here are the answers: 1. Report how many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity, grouped by the resource(s) associated with its performance. `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` 2. Report the total number of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity associated with each resource. `SELECT count(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` 3. Report the number of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity associated with each resource. `SELECT count(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` 4. How many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity, grouped by resource associated with its performance? `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` 5. Report the amount of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity associated with each resource. `SELECT count(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` And finally, the last one: 6.

Based on the provided SQL examples and database schema, I'll answer the questions: 1. What are the actions related to permits and explicit declarations in the declaration management process? The SQL query SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%permit%' OR activity LIKE '%declaration%' returns the distinct activities related to permits and declarations. 2. Which of the activities involve 'permit' or 'declaration' actions? The same SQL query as above returns the activities that involve 'permit' or 'declaration' actions. 3. What activities involve 'permit' or 'declaration'? Again, the same SQL query returns the activities that involve 'permit' or 'declaration'. 4. What activities involve a permit or declaration? The same SQL query returns the activities that involve a permit or declaration. 5. What information is associated with permit interventions, within the processing of a declaration? The SQL query SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%Permit%' returns all the information (id, activity, timestamp, resource, cost, idcase) associated with permit interventions during the processing of a declaration. 6. Actions related to permits were performed during the processing of which declarations? To answer this question, we would need to join the event_log table with another table that contains information about declarations. However, based on the provided schema, we don't have such a table. We would need additional information to answer this question.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'Permit%' GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 This query groups the event log by idcase and counts the number of times each idcase has an activity that starts with 'Permit'. The HAVING clause filters the results to only include idcases that have more than one 'Permit' activity.
SELECT id, idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE (idcase, timestamp) IN ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) ORDER BY timestamp;
SELECT idcase, id, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE (idcase, timestamp) IN ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) ORDER BY timestamp;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: Identify the last event performed for each case and list the identifiers of these events in order of performance. */ SELECT id FROM event_log WHERE id IN (SELECT MAX(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase) ORDER BY timestamp DESC; This query works by first selecting the maximum id for each idcase group, which corresponds to the last event performed for each case. Then, it orders the results by the timestamp in descending order, so the most recent events are listed first.
/* Answer the following: List the last events performed, considering each case, listing the identifiers following the order in which the events were performed. */ SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE (idcase, timestamp) IN ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) ORDER BY idcase, timestamp DESC;
SELECT id, idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE id IN ( SELECT MAX(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: For each process instance, retrieve the identifier of the last event, ordering the list by the event performance time. */ SELECT idcase, id FROM event_log WHERE id IN ( SELECT MAX(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) ORDER BY timestamp DESC; This query works as follows: 1. The subquery SELECT MAX(id) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase finds the maximum id for each idcase, which corresponds to the last event for each process instance. 2. The outer query SELECT idcase, id FROM event_log WHERE id IN (...) retrieves the idcase and id for each process instance, using the results from the subquery. 3. The ORDER BY timestamp DESC clause sorts the result by the timestamp in descending order, so that the most recent events are listed first. Note that this assumes that the id column is the primary key of the event_log table, and that it increments monotonically for each new event. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.
SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(activity) IN (SELECT Count(activity) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY Count(activity) Desc LIMIT 10) ORDER BY COUNT(activity) DESC;
SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, timestamp, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp DESC) AS row_num FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE row_num = 1 ORDER BY idcase;

SELECT resource, activity, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%employee%' OR activity LIKE '%supervisor%' OR activity LIKE '%administration%' OR activity LIKE '%pre-approver%' OR activity LIKE '%budget owner%' OR activity LIKE '%director%' GROUP BY resource, activity ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, here is the answer to the last question: /* Answer the following: Present a list of activities previously associated with a resource group as specified in its label (employee, supervisor, administration, pre-approver, budget owner, supervisor, director). The list must be ordered according to the number of times a group's activities were performed. */ SELECT grupo, COUNT(*) AS activity_count, activity FROM (SELECT CASE WHEN activity LIKE '%employee%' THEN 'employee' WHEN activity LIKE '%supervisor%' THEN'supervisor' WHEN activity LIKE '%administration%' THEN 'administration' WHEN activity LIKE '%pre-approver%' THEN 'pre-approver' WHEN activity LIKE '%budget owner%' THEN 'budget owner' WHEN activity LIKE '%director%' THEN 'director' END AS grupo, activity FROM event_log) AS grouped_activities GROUP BY grupo, activity ORDER BY activity_count DESC; This query uses a subquery to group the activities by the resource group labels (employee, supervisor, administration, pre-approver, budget owner, supervisor, director). The main query then groups the results by the grupo and activity columns, and orders the results by the activity_count in descending order.
SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase), 'employee' as grupo FROM event_log WHERE activity like '%employee%' UNION SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase),'supervisor' as grupo FROM event_log WHERE activity like '%supervisor%' UNION SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase), 'administration' as grupo FROM event_log WHERE activity like '%administration%' UNION SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase), 'pre-approver' as grupo FROM event_log WHERE activity like '%pre-approver%' UNION SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase), 'budget owner' as grupo FROM event_log WHERE activity like '%budget owner%' UNION SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase), 'director' as grupo FROM event_log WHERE activity like '%director%'
select e1.activity, e1.resource, e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp
SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp
Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, the answer to the question "In which cases are events included after the completion of the trip is recorded?" is: The events included after the completion of the trip is recorded are those that occurred in the same case (i.e., same "idcase") and have a timestamp greater than the timestamp of the "End trip" event. The SQL query that answers this question is: SELECT e1.idcase FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp This query returns the "idcase" values for the cases where events occurred after the "End trip" event.
select e1.activity, e1.resource, e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp
SELECT e1.idcase, e1.activity, e1.timestamp FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp ORDER BY e1.idcase;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: Which declarations received the register of actions even after they registered end of the trip? */ SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND timestamp > (SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND idcase = event_log.idcase) This query finds the declarations that have a 'Start trip' activity with a timestamp later than the latest 'End trip' activity timestamp for the same declaration. This indicates that the declaration received the register of actions even after they registered end of the trip.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Send reminder' AND id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM event_log WHERE idcase = event_log.idcase)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Send reminder' AND id = (SELECT MAX(id) FROM event_log WHERE idcase = event_log.idcase)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Send reminder' ORDER BY timestamp DESC
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Send reminder' AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log WHERE idcase = event_log.idcase AND activity!= 'Send reminder' AND timestamp > event_log.timestamp )
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Send reminder' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1;
SELECT COUNT(*) AS stuck_declarations FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase AND e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp WHERE e1.activity = 'Send reminder' AND e2.activity NOT LIKE 'Send reminder%'
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: What are the resources that were not working on March 31, 2018? */ SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp < '2018-03-31' OR timestamp > '2018-03-31' This query selects the distinct resources that were not working on March 31, 2018. It does this by selecting all resources from the event_log table where the timestamp is either before March 31, 2018 (i.e., the resource was not working on March 31, 2018) or after March 31, 2018 (i.e., the resource was not working on March 31, 2018).
SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp < '2018-03-31' OR timestamp > '2018-03-31' AND resource NOT IN ( SELECT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp = '2018-03-31' )
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp!= '2018-03-31' OR resource IS NULL This query selects all distinct resources that were not associated with events performed on March 31, 2018. The OR resource IS NULL part ensures that resources that were not used or reported are also included in the result.
SELECT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp = '2018-03-31' AND resource IS NULL
SELECT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp < '2018-03-31' OR (timestamp = '2018-03-31' AND activity IS NULL) GROUP BY resource HAVING NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log WHERE resource = event_log.resource AND timestamp = '2018-03-31' )
SELECT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp = '2018-03-31' AND idcase IS NOT NULL GROUP BY resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) = 0

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' OR activity = 'Payment handled')
Based on the provided SQL examples, the answer to the question "Indicate how many declarations do not have a record of payment made to date" is: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled') This query counts the number of distinct idcase values that do not have a record of payment made (i.e., where the activity is not 'Payment handled').
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1 )
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT resource), activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: For each activity, how many distinct resources were associated with its performance? */ SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT resource) FROM event_log GROUP BY activity This query uses the COUNT(DISTINCT resource) function to count the number of distinct resources associated with each activity. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by the activity column.
SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT resource) AS num_resources FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT resource) AS num_resources FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT resource) FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT resource) AS num_employees FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT el1.activity AS previous_activity, el2.activity AS send_reminder FROM event_log el1 JOIN event_log el2 ON el1.id = el2.id - 1 WHERE el1.activity!= 'Send reminder' AND el2.activity = 'Send reminder' ORDER BY el1.timestamp;
SELECT el1.idcase, el1.activity, el1.timestamp FROM event_log el1 JOIN ( SELECT idcase, MAX(timestamp) AS max_timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Send reminder' GROUP BY idcase ) el2 ON el1.idcase = el2.idcase AND el1.timestamp < el2.max_timestamp WHERE el1.activity!= 'Send reminder' ORDER BY el1.idcase, el1.timestamp;
SELECT e1.activity, e1.resource, e1.idcase FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Send reminder' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp ORDER BY e1.timestamp;
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_events, HISTOGRAM(num_events) AS distribution FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY num_events;
SELECT count_events, COUNT(*) as num_cases FROM ( SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) as count_events FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase ) as subquery GROUP BY count_events ORDER BY count_events;

SELECT count(*) as event_count, count(distinct idcase) as num_cases FROM event_log GROUP BY count(*) ORDER BY event_count;
SELECT COUNT(idcase), COUNT(*) as num_actions FROM event_log GROUP BY COUNT(idcase) ORDER BY num_actions;
SELECT AVG(SUM(cost)) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase
SELECT AVG(SUM(cost)) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase
SELECT AVG(SUM(cost)) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase
SELECT AVG(SUM(cost)) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase
SELECT AVG(SUM(cost)) FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase

SELECT resource, AVG(cost) FROM event_log GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, AVG(cost) AS mean_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY resource;
SELECT resource, AVG(cost) AS mean_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY resource;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT resource, AVG(cost) AS mean_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY resource; This query groups the events by the "resource" column and calculates the average cost of events for each group using the AVG() function. The result is a list of resources with their corresponding mean costs.
SELECT employee, AVG(cost) AS mean_cost FROM event_log GROUP BY employee
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM event_log GROUP BY resource ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 10;

Here is the answer to the last question: /* Answer the following: For cases in which there was the 'declaration final approved by director' activity, report how many events preceded the occurrence of this activity. */ SELECT AVG(preceding_events) AS average_preceding_events FROM ( SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS preceding_events FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' GROUP BY idcase ) AS preceding_events_count This query uses a subquery to count the number of events that preceded the occurrence of the 'Declaration final approved by director' activity for each case. The outer query then calculates the average number of preceding events across all cases. Note that this assumes that the 'idcase' column in the event_log table uniquely identifies each case. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly.
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_interventions FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration final approved by director' GROUP BY idcase
SELECT activity, count(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration approved by supervisor' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2018-01-01' GROUP BY activity UNION SELECT activity, count(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Permit rejected by employee' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2019-01-01' GROUP BY activity

Based on the provided SQL examples, I'll help you answer the question: "In which cases was there rework?" The answer is similar to the first SQL example: SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM (SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log) where activity = next_activity This query identifies cases where the same activity was performed consecutively, indicating rework. The `LEAD` function is used to get the next activity for each case, and the `WHERE` clause filters out cases where the current activity is the same as the next activity. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each case is only listed once, even if there are multiple consecutive occurrences of the same activity.
SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM (SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log) WHERE activity = next_activity;
