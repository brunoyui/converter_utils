select count(*), e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp group by e1.idcase
A SQL challenge! Let's break down each question and provide the answers: 1. In how many cases did the 'end trip' activity occur considering the time interval of 05/02/2017 and 05/12/2017? Answer: `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-05-02' and '2017-05-12'` This query counts the number of distinct `idcase` values where the `activity` is 'End trip' and the `timestamp` falls within the specified date range. 2. How many activity occurrences were recorded in each case until the 'end trip' activity was performed? Answer: `select count(*), e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp group by e1.idcase` This query joins the `event_log` table with itself, linking each row to the corresponding 'End trip' event. It then counts the number of rows for each `idcase` value before the 'End trip' event. 3. How many occurrences of activities were recorded in each case until the 'end trip' activity occurred? Answer: Same as question 2. 4. How many instances of activity were recorded in each case until it went through the 'end trip' activity? Answer: Same as question 2. 5. How many events occurred in each case before it went through the 'end trip' activity? Answer: Same as question 2. 6. How many occurrences of the 'end trip' activity are there in the event log? Answer: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip'` This query simply counts the number of rows where the `activity` is 'End trip'. Note that questions 2-5 are asking for the same information, just phrased differently. The correct answer is the same for all of them.
Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, the answer to the question "How many times did the 'end trip' activity occur?" is: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip'; This query will count the number of rows in the event_log table where the activity is 'End trip'.
select count(*), e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp < e2.timestamp group by e1.idcase
Based on the provided SQL examples, the answer to the question "How many times was the activity named 'end trip' performed?" is: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip'; This query will count the number of rows in the event_log table where the activity is 'End trip'.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND resource = 'James'
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND resource = 'James'
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS total_actions, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS unique_actions FROM event_log GROUP BY resource ORDER BY total_actions DESC;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Peter';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Peter';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Peter'
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' AND strftime('%Y-%m', timestamp) = '2018-03' This query selects the `idcase` column from the `event_log` table where the `activity` is 'End trip' and the `timestamp` is in March 2018. The `strftime` function is used to extract the year and month from the `timestamp` column, and the `DISTINCT` keyword is used to remove duplicates.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-03-01' AND '2018-04-01' This query selects the `idcase` column from the `event_log` table where the `timestamp` falls between March 1st, 2018 and April 1st, 2018. This will return the cases that ended in March 2018.
SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING strftime('%Y-%m', MAX(timestamp)) = '2018-03';
Based on the provided database schema and the question, the correct SQL query to answer the question "How many different people performed activities?" would be: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log This query uses the COUNT(DISTINCT) function to count the number of unique values in the idcase column, which represents the different people who performed activities.
To answer the question "How many different resources performed activities?", you can use the following SQL query: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT resource) FROM event_log This query uses the COUNT(DISTINCT) function to count the number of unique resources in the event_log table. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each resource is only counted once, even if it appears multiple times in the table.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases FROM event_log;
SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING MAX(cost) > 2225
Here is the answer: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' OR activity = 'Request payment'
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE (activity = 'Start trip' OR activity = 'End trip') AND idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' INTERSECT SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled');

SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31';
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp) = 2017 This query uses the EXTRACT function to extract the year from the timestamp column and then filters the results to only include rows where the year is 2017.
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE strftime('%Y', timestamp) = '2017';
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31';
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31' AND idcase IS NOT NULL This query selects all rows from the `event_log` table where the `timestamp` is between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017, and the `idcase` is not null (i.e., it's a declaration).
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2018-01-01' ORDER BY timestamp, resource;
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2018-01-01' AND idcase LIKE 'declaration %';

SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as count FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31' GROUP BY activity ORDER BY count DESC;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) <= 20; This query groups the event log by the `idcase` column and then filters the results to only include those with 20 or fewer events.
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) as count FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND strftime('%Y', timestamp) = '2016' GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS count_start_trip FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND strftime('%Y', timestamp) = '2016' GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) AS num_performances FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND strftime('%Y', timestamp) = '2016' GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Start trip' AND timestamp >= '2016-01-01' AND timestamp < '2017-01-01' GROUP BY resource
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 20; This query groups the event log by the idcase column and then counts the number of rows (i.e., activity occurrences) for each group. The HAVING clause filters the results to only include groups where the count is greater than 20.
SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 20
SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 20
/* Answer the following: In which cases are there more than twenty occurrences of activities performed? */ SELECT idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY idcase HAVING COUNT(*) > 20
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Sara' AND idcase NOT IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' )

Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, the answer to the question "How many times did the 'Thomas' resource perform an activity in 2017?" would be: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'; This query counts the number of rows in the event_log table where the resource is 'Thomas' and the timestamp falls within the year 2017.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31';
Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, the answer to the question "How many activity performances were carried out by the 'Thomas' resource in 2017?" is: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'; This query counts the number of rows in the event_log table where the resource is 'Thomas' and the timestamp falls within the year 2017.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2018-01-01';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31';
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Report the most recent date of the performance of each activity. */ SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS most_recent_date FROM event_log GROUP BY activity This query uses the `MAX` function to find the most recent date for each activity, and the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by activity. The `AS` keyword is used to give an alias to the `MAX(timestamp)` column, which is named `most_recent_date`.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS most_recent_date FROM event_log GROUP BY activity; This query groups the event log by activity and then selects the maximum timestamp for each group, which corresponds to the most recent event for each activity.
Here is the answer: /* Answer the following: What are the most recent performance dates for each of the activities present in the event log? */ SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS latest_timestamp FROM event_log GROUP BY activity ORDER BY activity; This query uses the `MAX` function to retrieve the most recent performance date for each activity, and the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by activity. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results by activity name.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: For each activity relevant to the event log, report the date of its last occurrence. */ SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS last_occurrence FROM event_log GROUP BY activity This query uses the `MAX` function to find the latest timestamp for each activity, effectively giving us the date of its last occurrence. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by activity, so we get one row per activity with the corresponding last occurrence date.
Based on the provided database schema and the question, the answer would be: /* Answer the following: Most recent date of performance of each activity: */ SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS most_recent_date FROM event_log GROUP BY activity This SQL query will return the most recent date of performance for each activity. The `MAX` function is used to get the latest timestamp for each activity, and the `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by activity.
SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS last_timestamp FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT activity, MAX(timestamp) AS "performance_end_date", idcase FROM event_log GROUP BY activity, idcase ORDER BY MAX(timestamp) DESC;

Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Charles' AND strftime('%Y-%m', timestamp)!= '2018-01' This query selects the `idcase` column from the `event_log` table where the `resource` column is 'Charles' and the `timestamp` column is not in January 2018 (i.e., not '2018-01').
SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Charles' AND idcase NOT IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', timestamp) = '2018-01' )
SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', timestamp)!= '2018-01' GROUP BY idcase ) AND resource = 'Charles'
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Charles' AND timestamp NOT BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-01-31' This query selects the `idcase` values from the `event_log` table where the `resource` is 'Charles' and the `timestamp` is not between January 1, 2018 and January 31, 2018. This effectively disregards cases that had events occurring in January 2018.

Here is the answer to the last question: /* Answer the following: Who was the employee who performed the last activity ever recorded in the travel declaration process and what was that activity? */ SELECT resource, activity FROM event_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1; This query uses the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the rows in the `event_log` table by the `timestamp` column in descending order (newest first). The `LIMIT 1` clause then returns only the first row, which is the most recent activity ever recorded in the travel declaration process. The `SELECT` clause returns the `resource` and `activity` columns for this row, which identifies the employee who performed the last activity and what that activity was.

SELECT resource, count(*) as rejection_count FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource ORDER BY rejection_count DESC;
SELECT count(DISTINCT idcase), activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
Based on the provided SQL examples, I will answer the question: "Various actions, activities or tasks are possible when processing a declaration. It is useful to know the number of declarations associated with the performance of each of these actions, activities or tasks." The SQL query to answer this question is: SELECT activity, COUNT(*) as declaration_count FROM event_log GROUP BY activity This query will return a list of activities, along with the number of declarations associated with each activity. The result will be ordered by the activity name.
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'R%' AND timestamp > ( SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'D%' )
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'R%' AND timestamp > (SELECT MAX(timestamp) FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE 'D%')

SELECT resource, activity, COUNT(*) FROM event_log GROUP BY resource, activity
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01';
Here is the answer: SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01' This query will return a list of activities that were performed during the first semester of 2018 (January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2018). The DISTINCT keyword is used to ensure that each activity is only listed once, even if it was performed multiple times during this period.
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-31';
SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-06-30'

SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Request payment', 'Payment handled') )
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Request payment', 'Payment handled') ); This query will return the identifiers of cases that do not have any records of the'request payment' or 'payment handled' activities.
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Report for which process instances there is no record of events associated with the'request payment' or 'payment handled' activities. */ SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Request payment' OR activity = 'Payment handled')
SELECT DISTINCT e.idcase FROM event_log AS e WHERE e.activity NOT IN ('Request payment', 'Payment handled') ORDER BY e.idcase;
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Request payment', 'Payment handled') )

SELECT resource, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'declaration saved by employee' GROUP BY resource ORDER BY resource;
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'declaration saved by employee' GROUP BY resource ORDER BY resource;
Here is the answer: SELECT resource, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'declaration saved by employee' GROUP BY resource ORDER BY resource; This query will return the number of associations between each resource and the performance of the 'declaration saved by employee' activity, sorted by resource.
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Save declaration' GROUP BY resource ORDER BY resource;
SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS num_cases FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), activity FROM event_log GROUP BY activity
SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS num_activities FROM event_log GROUP BY resource
The SQL query to answer the question "In how many different activities was each resource associated?" is: SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) FROM event_log GROUP BY resource This query uses the COUNT(DISTINCT activity) function to count the number of unique activities associated with each resource. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by the resource column.
SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) FROM event_log GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) FROM event_log GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS num_activities FROM event_log GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) AS num_actions FROM event_log GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, COUNT(DISTINCT activity) as distinct_actions FROM event_log GROUP BY resource
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('End trip', 'Make a payment') GROUP BY resource
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by pre-approver' GROUP BY resource
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS activity_count FROM event_log WHERE activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY idcase;
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_activities FROM event_log WHERE activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY idcase;
It seems like you're trying to solve some SQL queries based on an event log. Here's the answer to the last query: /* Answer the following: How many instances of activity were recorded in each case until it went through the 'end trip' activity? */ SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_activities FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase This query will give you the count of activities for each case until it reaches the 'end trip' activity. Note that this assumes that the 'end trip' activity marks the end of a case. If there are other activities after 'end trip', you might need to adjust the query accordingly.
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_events FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase
It seems like you're trying to answer a series of questions based on a given database schema. The schema defines a table called "event_log" which contains information about events that occurred in a process. Each event is associated with an activity, a timestamp, a resource, a cost, and a process instance. Here's the answer to the last question: /* Answer the following: Check the number of events that occurred in each process instance until it reached the performance of the 'end trip' activity. */ SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_events FROM event_log WHERE activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY num_events DESC; This query will return a list of process instances (identified by the "idcase" column) along with the number of events that occurred in each process instance until it reached the 'end trip' activity. The "ORDER BY" clause is used to sort the results in descending order based on the number of events.
SELECT idcase, COUNT(*) AS num_actions FROM event_log WHERE activity!= 'End trip' GROUP BY idcase
Here's the answer: SELECT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-31'
SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01'
Based on the provided database schema and SQL examples, the answer to the question "What types of actions did the employee Thomas work on in the first semester of 2018?" is: SELECT DISTINCT activity FROM event_log WHERE resource = 'Thomas' AND timestamp BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2018-07-01' This SQL query will return a list of unique activities performed by the employee Thomas in the first semester of 2018 (January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2018).
SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY idcase, timestamp
SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY idcase, timestamp
SELECT idcase, MIN(timestamp) AS start_time, MAX(timestamp) AS end_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY idcase ORDER BY start_time;
SELECT idcase, timestamp FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY timestamp ASC
Here are the answers to the SQL questions: 1. Report how many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity, grouped by the resource(s) associated with its performance. SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource 2. How many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity and which resources were responsible? SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource 3. How many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity, grouped by resource associated with its performance? SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource 4. How many declarations were rejected by a supervisor and which supervisors were involved? SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource 5. How many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity and what are the resources associated with carrying out these activities? SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource 6. Present, in ascending temporal order relative to the beginning of the case, the list of cases in which the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity was performed. SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY timestamp, idcase ASC
A SQL challenge! Here are the answers: 1. Report how many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity, grouped by the resource(s) associated with its performance. `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` 2. Report the total number of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity associated with each resource. `SELECT count(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` 3. Report the number of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity associated with each resource. `SELECT count(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` 4. How many cases went through the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity, grouped by resource associated with its performance? `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` 5. Report the amount of occurrences of the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity associated with each resource. `SELECT count(*), resource FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' GROUP BY resource` And finally, the last one: 6. Present, in ascending temporal order relative to the beginning of the process, the list of process instances in which the 'declaration rejected by supervisor' activity was performed. `SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Declaration rejected by supervisor' ORDER BY timestamp ASC` Note: The `ORDER BY timestamp ASC` clause is used to sort the results in ascending order by timestamp.

SELECT DISTINCT e1.idcase FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp
Based on the provided SQL examples and the given database schema, the answer to the question "In which cases are events included after the completion of the trip is recorded?" is: The events included after the completion of the trip is recorded are those that occurred in the same case (i.e., same "idcase") and have a timestamp greater than the timestamp of the "End trip" event. The SQL query that answers this question is: SELECT e1.idcase FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp This query returns the "idcase" values for the cases where events occurred after the "End trip" event.
select e1.activity, e1.resource, e1.idcase from event_log AS e1 inner join event_log AS e2 on e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' and e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp
SELECT e1.idcase, e1.activity, e1.timestamp FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e2.activity = 'End trip' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp ORDER BY e1.idcase;
Here is the SQL query to answer the question: /* Answer the following: What are the resources that were not working on March 31, 2018? */ SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp < '2018-03-31' OR timestamp > '2018-03-31' This query selects the distinct resources that were not working on March 31, 2018. It does this by selecting all resources from the event_log table where the timestamp is either before March 31, 2018 (i.e., the resource was not working on March 31, 2018) or after March 31, 2018 (i.e., the resource was not working on March 31, 2018).
SELECT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp = '2018-03-31' AND resource IS NULL
SELECT resource FROM event_log WHERE timestamp = '2018-03-31' AND idcase IS NOT NULL GROUP BY resource HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) = 0
SELECT activity, COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity
SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS frequency FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity ORDER BY frequency DESC;
SELECT activity, count(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity
SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) AS frequency FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity
SELECT activity, count(*) FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity
SELECT activity, COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2018-12-01' AND '2018-12-05' GROUP BY activity
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled')
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled')
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT idcase) FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN (SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled')
SELECT DISTINCT idcase FROM event_log WHERE idcase NOT IN ( SELECT idcase FROM event_log WHERE activity = 'Payment handled' ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1 )
SELECT e1.activity, e1.resource, e1.idcase FROM event_log AS e1 INNER JOIN event_log AS e2 ON e1.idcase = e2.idcase WHERE e1.activity = 'Send reminder' AND e1.timestamp > e2.timestamp ORDER BY e1.timestamp;
SELECT COUNT(idcase), COUNT(*) as num_actions FROM event_log GROUP BY COUNT(idcase) ORDER BY num_actions;
SELECT resource, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM event_log GROUP BY resource ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 10;
SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS date, COUNT(*) AS occurrences FROM event_log GROUP BY DATE(timestamp) ORDER BY date;
SELECT DATE(timestamp) AS date, COUNT(*) AS count FROM event_log GROUP BY DATE(timestamp) ORDER BY date;
Based on the provided SQL examples, I'll help you answer the question: "In which cases was there rework?" The answer is similar to the first SQL example: SELECT DISTINCT(idcase) FROM (SELECT idcase, activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log) where activity = next_activity This query identifies cases where the same activity was performed consecutively, indicating rework. The `LEAD` function is used to get the next activity for each case, and the `WHERE` clause filters out cases where the current activity is the same as the next activity. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each case is only listed once, even if there are multiple consecutive occurrences of the same activity.
SELECT idcase, activity FROM ( SELECT idcase, activity, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY idcase ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity FROM event_log ) AS subquery WHERE activity = prev_activity;
SELECT DISTINCT resource FROM event_log WHERE activity LIKE '%by supervisor%';
